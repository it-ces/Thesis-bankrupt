   abstract = {We have evaluated the toxicity of four glyphosate (G)-based herbicides in Roundup formulations, from 10(5) times dilutions, on three different human cell types. This dilution level is far below agricultural recommendations and corresponds to low levels of residues in food or feed. The formulations have been compared to G alone and with its main metabolite AMPA or with one known adjuvant of R formulations, POEA. HUVEC primary neonate umbilical cord vein cells have been tested with 293 embryonic kidney and JEG3 placental cell lines. All R formulations cause total cell death within 24 h, through an inhibition of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, and necrosis, by release of cytosolic adenylate kinase measuring membrane damage. They also induce apoptosis via activation of enzymatic caspases 3/7 activity. This is confirmed by characteristic DNA fragmentation, nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), which is demonstrated by DAPI in apoptotic round cells. G provokes only apoptosis, and HUVEC are 100 times more sensitive overall at this level. The deleterious effects are not proportional to G concentrations but rather depend on the nature of the adjuvants. AMPA and POEA separately and synergistically damage cell membranes like R but at different concentrations. Their mixtures are generally even more harmful with G. In conclusion, the R adjuvants like POEA change human cell permeability and amplify toxicity induced already by G, through apoptosis and necrosis. The real threshold of G toxicity must take into account the presence of adjuvants but also G metabolism and time-amplified effects or bioaccumulation. This should be discussed when analyzing the in vivo toxic actions of R. This work clearly confirms that the adjuvants in Roundup formulations are not inert. Moreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death around residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R formulation-treated crops.},

Entre estas se encuentran las neoplasias y las enfermedades isquémicas del corazón, por el lado de las enfermedades. Por el lado de las causas externas, las agresiones físicas y homicidios también tienen un gran impacto sobre la mortalidad del país, sobre todo para los hombres. Por regiones, las neoplasias son la principal causa de muerte para las mujeres en 30 de los 33 departamentos estudiados y para los hombres son los homicidios en 29 de 33 departamentos. También es importante señalar que en algunos departamentos de la región de la Amazonía las infecciones respiratorias agudas siguen siendo una de las tres principales causas de mortalidad. Este resultado pone en evidencia la pobreza y rezago económico y social que existe en estas zonas y la falta sistemática de políticas públicas enfocadas en combatir sus problemas específicos.},

   abstract = {This paper exploits variations in aerial spraying across time and space in Colombia and employs a panel of individual health records in order to study the causal effects of the aerial spraying of herbicides (glyphosate) on short-term health-related outcomes. Our results show that exposure to the herbicide used in aerial spraying campaigns increases the number of medical consultations related to dermatological and respiratory illnesses, as well as the number of miscarriages. These findings are robust to the inclusion of individual fixed effects, which compare the prevalence of these medical conditions for the same person under different levels of exposure to the herbicide used in the aerial spraying program over a period of 5 years. Also, our results are robust to controlling for the extent of illicit coca cultivation in the municipality of residence.},

   abstract = {Objective Estimate the Years of Life Lost (YLL) for overall and avoidable causes of death (CoD) in Co-lombia for the period 1998-2011. Methods From the reported deaths to the Colombian mortality database during 1998-2011, we classified deaths from avoidable causes. With the reference life table of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study, we estimated the overall YLL and YLL due to avoidable causes. Calculations were performed with the difference between life expectancy and the age of death. Results are reported by group of cause of death, events, sex, year and department. Comparative analysis between number of deaths and YLL was carried out. Results A total of 83,856,080 YLL were calculated in Colombia during period 1998-2011, 75.9% of them due to avoidable CoD. The year 2000 reported the highest number of missed YLL by both overall and avoidable CoD. The departments with the highest YLL rates were Caquetá, Guaviare, Arauca, Meta, and Risaralda. In men, intentional injuries and cardiovascular and circulatory diseases had the higher losses, while in women YLL were mainly due to cardio-vascular and circulatory diseases. Conclusions The public health priorities should focus on preventing the loss of YLL due to premature death and differentiated interventions by sex.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Assessments of age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. 

METHODS
The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. 

FINDINGS
Globally, 18·7% (95% uncertainty interval 18·4–19·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58·8% (58·2–59·3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48·1 years (46·5–49·6) to 70·5 years (70·1–70·8) for men and from 52·9 years (51·7–54·0) to 75·6 years (75·3–75·9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49·1 years (46·5–51·7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87·6 years (86·9–88·1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216·0 deaths (196·3–238·1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38·9 deaths (35·6–42·83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5·4 million (5·2–5·6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. 

INTERPRETATION
This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
An estimate at the national level of the occupational cancer burden brought about by the industrial use of asbestos requires detailed routine information on such uses as well as on vital statistics of good quality. A causal association with asbestos exposure has been established for mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx, and ovary. 

OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to provide estimates of the occupational burden of asbestos-related cancer for the Latin American countries that are or have been the highest asbestos consumers in the region: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. 

METHODS
The burden of multifactorial cancers has been estimated through the approach suggested for the World Health Organization using the population attributable fraction. The following data were used:•Proportion of workforce employed in each economic sector•Proportion of workers exposed to asbestos in each sector•Occupational turnover•Levels of exposure•Proportion of the population in the workforce•Relative risk for each considered disease for 1 or more levels of exposure Data on the proportion of workers exposed to asbestos in each sector are not available for Latin American countries; therefore, data from the European CAREX database (carcinogen exposure database) were used. 

FINDINGS
Using mortality data of the World Health Organization Health Statistics database for the year 2009 and applying the estimated values for population attributable fractions, the number of estimated deaths in 5 years for mesothelioma and for lung, larynx, and ovary cancers attributable to occupational asbestos exposures, were respectively 735, 233, 29, and 14 for Argentina; 340, 611, 68, and 43 for Brazil; 255, 97, 14, and 9 for Colombia, and 1075, 219, 18, and 22 for Mexico. 

CONCLUSIONS
The limitations in compiling the estimates highlight the need for improvement in the quality of asbestos-related environmental and health data. Nevertheless, the figures are already usable to promote a ban on asbestos use.},

   abstract = {Manizales, a mid-size city in Colombia, hosts industries like metallurgy, electrical, chemical, and rubber and plastic industrial facilities that have released into atmosphere some pollutants postulated as thyroid cancer (TC) promoters, such as dioxins and furans, dichloromethane, lead and copper. In this article we aim to detect clusters of TC and analyze their spatial association with industrial pollution. TC cases (2003–2010) were obtained from Manizales' Population-based Cancer Registry (PCR-Mz). Atmospheric emissions from industries were obtained from official reports of environmental authority. Data was spatially aggregated into census tracts and analyzed with Bayesian Besag-York and Mollié (BYM) models. Three exposure approaches were used: i) presence or absence of industries into census tracts, ii) sum of air discharges, and iii) an exposure index (EI) that considered the distance and orientation of the census tract regard to industries, average wind direction and speed, and population mobility. Models were fitted by exposure definition and sex, and included traffic and socioeconomic variables for adjustment. Using the Kulldorff's spatial exploration statistic we also performed point-data analyses in order to detect and localize clusters with individual data. Ecological regression models showed that, for women, smoothed standardized incidence ratio (sSIR) increase in 15% [95% credibility interval: 3–27%] and 63% [95%CI: 18–125%] per one standard deviation increase in EI for dichloromethane and PCDDs/Fs, respectively. Point-data analysis confirmed a cluster of female cases close to an industry emitting chlorinated solvents. These results suggest that dichloromethane and PCDDs/Fs emitted from industrial sources might be suspected as thyroid cancer risk factors.},

   abstract = {Recent increases have been reported in industrial countries for several sites of cancer. The causes of these increases remain unknown. Efforts should proceed to identify those occupational groups with increases in the same sites, as these may indicate relevant exposures. Two analyses were undertaken: trends in cancer mortality in industrial countries were reviewed to identify recently increasing sites and summaries were compiled of studies on farmers which have shown increased risks for these same sites of cancer. Using data provided by the World Health Organization, age-specific rates were developed for a number of sites of cancer from 1968 to 1986. Trends in the ratio of male to female cancer mortality were also assessed for several of these countries. Based on a literature review by the National Cancer Institute, patterns of cancer in farmers reported in 20 studies from 8 countries are summarized, weighting each study by its size to create combined relative risks. In industrial countries, rates of cancer mortality increased for a number of sites, including melanoma, prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast, brain, and kidney cancer. The ratio of male to female cancer mortality (for all sites of cancer excluding lung) has generally increased in several countries during this same time period. Many of the same sites that have increased in the general population have also been found to be increasing in farmers. Significant excesses occurred for Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia, skin melanomas, and cancers of the lip, stomach, and prostate. Nonsignificant increases in risk were also noted for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers of connective tissue and brain in many surveys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Socioeconomic inequalities in female cancer incidence have previously been undocumented in Japan. 

METHODS
Using a nationwide inpatient dataset (1984–2016) in Japan, we identified 143,806 female cancer cases and 703,157 controls matched for sex, age, admission date, and admitting hospital, and performed a hospital-based matched case-control study. Based on standardized national classification, we categorized patients’ socioeconomic status (SES) by occupational class (blue-collar, service, professional, manager), cross-classified by industry sector (blue-collar, service, white-collar). Using blue-collar workers in blue-collar industries as the reference group, we estimated the odds ratio (OR) for each cancer incidence using conditional logistic regression with multiple imputation, adjusted for major modifiable risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption). 

RESULTS
We identified lower risks among higher-SES women for common and overall cancers: e.g., ORs for managers in blue-collar industries were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.98) for stomach cancer and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.19–0.86) for lung cancer. Higher risks with higher SES were evident for breast cancer: the OR for professionals in service industries was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.29–1.98). With some cancers, homemakers showed a similar trend to subjects with higher SES; however, the magnitude of the OR was weaker than those with higher SES. 

CONCLUSIONS
Even after controlling for major modifiable risk factors, socioeconomic inequalities were evident for female cancer incidence in Japan.},

Using data from the Agricultural Health Study, a cohort of 89,656 pesticide applicators and their spouses (N = 89, 656) in North Carolina and Iowa, the authors computed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing deaths from time of the enrollment (1993-1997) through 2007 to state-specific rates. To compensate for the cohort's overall healthiness, relative SMRs were estimated by calculating the SMR for each cause relative to the SMR for all other causes. In 1,198,129 person-years of follow-up, 6,419 deaths were observed. The all-cause mortality rate was less than expected (SMR(applicators) = 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.55; SMR(spouses) = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.55). SMRs for all cancers, heart disease, and diabetes were significantly below 1.0. In contrast, applicators experienced elevated numbers of machine-related deaths (SMR = 4.15, 95% CI: 3.18, 5.31), motor vehicle nontraffic accidents (SMR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.81, 4.14), and collisions with objects (SMR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.34). In the relative SMR analysis for applicators, the relative mortality ratio was elevated for lymphohematopoietic cancers, melanoma, and digestive system, prostate, kidney, and brain cancers. Among spouses, relative SMRs exceeded 1.0 for lymphohematopoietic cancers and malignancies of the digestive system, brain, breast, and ovary. Unintentional fatal injuries remain an important risk for farmers; mortality ratios from several cancers were elevated relative to other causes.},

Studies were assessed against eligibility criteria and a narrative summary of findings presented. RESULTS Eighteen primary research articles were included in the review. Four of ten mortality studies and two of nine incidence studies reported statistically significant increases in prostate cancer risk in farmers. However, nearly half of all studies reported non-significant reductions in farmers' risk. Additionally, one study reported significantly increased and decreased risk using different outcome measures. Results varied considerably by geographic region, study design and degree of control for confounders, affecting comparability and strength of findings.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Farm workers seem to be at an increased risk of developing some cancers, notably in the brain. One of the hypotheses rose to explain such elevated risk is the intense exposure to pesticides. AIM To estimate the brain cancer mortality risk among agricultural workers exposed to pesticides in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS A case-control study based on death certificates of males, 18 years or older, resident in the State Rio de Janeiro who died between 1996 and 2005. Cases (n=2040) were defined as individuals with brain cancer as the underlying cause of death. For each case two controls (n=4140) were randomly selected in the same database, matched for age group and region of residence. Besides the descriptive analysis, crude and adjusted odds ratios and mortality odds ratio (MOR) according to quartiles of potential exposure to pesticides, were calculated. RESULTS Agricultural workers showed higher brain cancer mortality risk estimates when compared with non-farm workers (aOR: 1.82, 95% CI 1.21-2.71). In addition, the magnitude of this association was higher among white patients, with higher education, and residence in an agricultural region. CONCLUSION This study suggests an association between agricultural work and brain cancer mortality in Rio de Janeiro state. It also suggests that pesticide exposure may play a role in such risk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The etiology of prostate cancer continues to be poorly understood, including the role of occupation. Past Canadian studies have not been able to thoroughly examine prostate cancer by occupation with detailed information on individual level factors. METHODS Occupation, industry and prostate cancer were examined using data from the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System, a large population-based case-control study conducted across eight Canadian provinces from 1994 to 1997. This analysis included 1737 incident cases and 1803 controls aged 50 to 79 years. Lifetime occupational histories were used to group individuals by occupation and industry employment. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and adjustments were made for known and possible risk factors. RESULTS By occupation, elevated risks were observed in farming and farm management (OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.84), armed forces (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.65) and legal work (OR=2.58, 95% CI 1.05-6.35). Elevated risks were also observed in office work (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.43) and plumbing (OR=1.77, 95% CI 1.07-2.93) and with ≥10 years duration of employment. Decreased risks were observed in senior management (OR=0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91), construction management (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94) and travel work (OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.88). Industry results were similar to occupation results, except for an elevated risk in forestry/logging (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.25) and a decreased risk in primary metal products (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.96). CONCLUSION This study presents associations between occupation, industry and prostate cancer, while accounting for individual level factors. Further research is needed on potential job-specific exposures and screening behaviours.},

Farmers and nonfarming rural men had significantly lower morbidity risks of cancer and of psychiatric disorders than urban referents. Farmers had significantly lower risk of endocrine disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory disorders. In general, morbidity was lower among nonfarming rural men compared with urban referents and was even lower among farmers. Urban referents had, however, significantly less musculoskeletal disorder morbidity. An urban-rural factor and a farming occupational or lifestyle factor results in lower mortality and morbidity rates except concerning musculoskeletal disorders.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES To compare mortality by cancer sites and by other specific causes of death, and the prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers and non-farmers in Spain. METHODS Mortality by cause of death was calculated based on a longitudinal study with 10-years follow-up of 9.5 million men and 6 million women aged 20-64 years who were employed in 2001. The prevalence of risk behaviors was calculated from the 2001 National Health Survey in the 6464 employed men and 5573 employed women aged 20-64. The study subjects were grouped as farmers and non-farmers. For each cause of death, we estimated the ratio of age-standardized mortality rates, and for each risk behavior we estimated the age-standardized prevalence ratio in farmers versus non-farmers. RESULTS In men, the mortality rate for most cancer sites did not differ significantly between farmers and non-farmers, except for cancers of the lip, oral cavity, stomach, larynx and skin epidermoid carcinoma-which was higher in farmers-and cancers of the liver, pancreas and mesothelioma-which was lower in farmers. In contrast, farmers had a higher rate of mortality from most other diseases and from external causes of death. In women, farmers showed lower mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, and higher mortality from external causes. The prevalence of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and obesity was higher in farmers than in non-farmers, except smoking and excessive alcohol consumption in women where prevalence was lower in farmers. CONCLUSIONS Findings are different from those found in other studies. In men, greater exposure to the sun and the higher prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers could explain their excess mortality from some cancer sites and the other causes of death. However, other factors may be behind this excess risk of mortality from these causes, given that farmers did not show higher mortality from some cancers related to smoking. In women, no differences were observed in mortality rate for majority of causes of death between farmers and non-farmers.},

Whether this is due to the urban-rural health gradient or to occupational factors related to farming is not clear. To explore this issue, we conducted a prospective study of farmers and matched rural and urban referents. Official hospital admission and mortality data for the years 1989-1996 were obtained. The relative risk of being admitted to hospital were 10% higher among rural and urban referents than among the farmers. The biggest differences were seen for mental and cardiovascular disorders. The odds of dying during follow-up did not differ between the two rural groups but were doubled among urban referents. In conclusion, the lower morbidity and mortality rates among farmers are partly due to the urban-rural health gradient but in addition salutogenic factors linked to farming seem to be active.},

The aim of this study was to investigate suicide mortality ratios across broad occupational groups in Greece for both sexes in the period 2000-2009. METHODS Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60-X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30-39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50-59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths. CONCLUSION Further research is needed into the work-related stressors of occupations with high suicide mortality risk and focused suicide prevention strategies should be applied within vulnerable working age populations.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE To elaborate and describe a large prospective agricultural cohort including males and females in France with various agricultural activities and to study causes of death. METHODS To date, few large prospective cohorts have been conducted among agricultural population. AGRIculture and CANcer cohort is a large prospective cohort of subjects in agriculture studying cancer among active and retired males and females, farm owners and workers, living in eleven areas of France with a population-based cancer registry. RESULTS Enrollment was conducted from 2005 to 2007 with a postal questionnaire. In January 2008, 180,060 individuals (54 % males, 54 % farm owners, 50 % retired) were enrolled. Mortality was studied until December 2009 (605,956 person-years with standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by comparison with the general population of the areas. Over this period, 11,450 deaths 6,741 in men and 4,709 in women were observed, including 3,405 cancer-related deaths. SMRs were significantly reduced for global mortality (SMR = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.67-0.70 in males and SMR = 0.71, 95 % CI 0.69-0.73 in females) and for death by cancer (SMR = 0.67, 95 % CI 0.65, 0.70 in males and SMR = 0.76, 95 % C: 0.71, 0.80 in females). These results were mainly explained by less frequent smoking-related causes of death (lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases). Nonsignificant excesses of death were observed only for rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis, suicides (in females), death for event of undetermined intent (in males) and breast cancer in male agricultural workers. CONCLUSIONS These first results are the first ones obtained in France based on a large prospective agricultural cohort showing that farmers would be in healthier condition than the general population.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Sarcoidosis is a disease that is associated with occupational and environmental antigens, in the setting of a susceptible host. The aim of this study was to examine the association between sarcoidosis mortality and previously reported occupational exposures based on sex and race. METHODS The decedents enrolled in this study were derived from United States death certificates from 1988-1999. Cause of death was coded according to ICD-9 and ICD-10. The usual occupation was coded with Bureau of the Census Occupation Codes. Mortality odds ratio (MOR) were determined and multiple Poisson regression were performed to evaluate the independent exposure effects after adjustment for age, sex, race and other occupational exposures. RESULTS Of the 7,118,535 decedents in our study, 3,393 were identified as sarcoidosis-related, including 1,579 identified as sarcoidosis being the underlying cause of death. The sarcoidosis-related MOR of any occupational exposure was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.35-1.71). Women with any exposure demonstrated an increased MOR compared to women without (MOR 1.65, 95% CI, 1.45-1.89). The mortality risk was significantly elevated in those with employment involving metal working, health care, teaching, sales, banking, and administration. Higher sarcoidosis-related mortality risks associated with specific exposures were noted in women vs men and blacks vs whites. CONCLUSIONS Findings of prior occupations and risk of sarcoidosis were verified using sarcoidosis mortality rates. There were significant differences in risk for sarcoidosis mortality by occupational exposures based on sex and race.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE This analysis of the Agricultural Health Study cohort assesses the mortality experience of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses. METHODS This report is based on 52,393 private applicators (who are mostly farmers) and 32,345 spouses of farmers in Iowa and North Carolina. At enrollment, each pesticide applicator completed a 21-page enrollment questionnaire. Mortality assessment from enrollment (1994-1997) through 2000 provided an average follow-up of about 5.3 years, 447,154 person-years, and 2055 deaths. RESULTS Compared with the general population in the two states, the cohort experienced a very low mortality rate. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for total mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, total cancer, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and lung were 0.6 or lower for both farmers and spouses. These deficits varied little by farm size, type of crops or livestock on the farm, years of handling pesticides, holding a non-farm job, or length of follow up. SMRs among ever smokers were not as low as among never smokers, but were still less than 1.0 for all smoking-related causes of death. No statistically significant excesses occurred, but slightly elevated SMRs, or those near 1.0, were noted for diseases that have been associated with farming in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS Several factors may contribute to the low mortality observed in this population, including the healthy worker effect typically seen in cohorts of working populations (which may decline in future years), a short follow-up interval, and a healthier lifestyle manifested through lower cigarette use and an occupation that has traditionally required high levels of physical activity.},

   abstract = {One of the proposed hypotheses to explain the higher incidence of specific-site cancers among agricultural workers is their higher exposure to pesticides. The role of pesticide exposure in morbidity and mortality profiles in Brazil is not well known. Therefore, in order to contribute to increase knowledge on this subject, an ecological analysis aiming to investigate cancer mortality among agricultural workers in an important agricultural area of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, was performed. All causes of death for male workers 30-69 years old provided by the National Mortality Information System between 1979 and 1998 were evaluated. To estimate cancer mortality risks of selected sites, mortality odds ratio (MOR) was employed, and three reference populations were used. Higher mortality of esophagus, stomach, and larynx cancer in agricultural workers 50-69 years old was observed in the period from 1979 to 1988 and of esophagus and stomach cancer from 1989 to 1998. Agricultural workers 30-49 years old showed higher, but not statistically significant, mortality by stomach, esophagus, liver, testis, and prostate cancer, and soft-tissue sarcoma in the period of 1979-1988, and by testis and penis cancer, leukemia, and soft-tissue sarcoma in the period of 1989-1998. Despite the limitations of ecological approaches concerning causality ascertainment, we believe that this study raises questions of the possible role of pesticide exposure on the cancer mortality profile among Brazilian agricultural workers.},

However, some recent studies indicated that if there is an association between agricultural working and esophageal cancer, it s more likely to be observed among workers highly exposed to pesticides. In the present study, the magnitude of the association between agricultural working and esophageal cancer mortality was evaluated in a high pesticide use area in Brazil, through a death certificate-based case-control study. Cases were individuals from both genders, 30-59 years old, for whom basic cause of death was ascertained as cancer of the esophagus. For each case, one control was randomly selected from all possible controls for which the basic cause of death was ascertained as different from neoplasm and diseases of the digestive system. In addition, controls matched their cases by sex, age, year of death, and state of residence. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were then calculated to estimate the magnitude of the risk. Results showed that, in general, agricultural workers were at significantly higher risk to die by esophageal cancer, when compared to non-agricultural workers. Stratified analysis also revealed that the magnitude of such risk was slightly higher among illiterate agricultural workers, and simultaneous adjustment for several covariates showed that the risk was quantitatively higher among younger southern agricultural workers. These results suggest the esophageal cancer may be included among those types of cancer etiologically associated to agricultural working.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION The association between pesticide use and an increased suicide risk is a controversial issue. Previous studies have shown higher rates of suicide among agricultural workers and people living in small municipalities, but have not identified the causes of these results. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between pesticide exposure and suicide rates. METHODS Crude suicide rates of a 15-year time series (1996-2010) were examined, followed by an ecological study using age-standardized suicide rates for the period 2006-2010. The unit of analysis was all 558 Brazilian micro-regions. Pesticide exposure was evaluated according to the proportion of farms that used pesticides and had reported cases of pesticide poisonings. The statistics were analysed using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors. RESULTS Among the age group that was analysed, the mean suicide rate was 6.4 cases/100,000 per year in the 2006-2010 period, with a male/female ratio of 4.2. The times series showed that there were higher suicide rates among people aged 35-64 years and among men aged 15-34 years. The ecological analysis showed that the suicide rates were higher in micro-regions with a higher proportion of farms run by 35-64 year olds, female workers and on farms with better economic indicators (higher farming income, level of mechanization and farm area). There was a positive association between the Catholic religion and suicide rates. Micro-regions with a greater use of pesticides, and with a high proportion of pesticide poisoning had the highest suicide rates for all three groups analysed: both genders, men, and women (p ranging from 0.01 to p<0.001). CONCLUSION This study reinforces the hypothesis that pesticide use and pesticide poisoning increase the suicide rates. However, due to the limitations of the study's ecological design, such as ecological fallacy, further appropriately designed studies are needed to confirm the causal relationships.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews epidemiologic studies of cancer among agricultural populations to identify possible associations and to provide a focus for future investigations. Meta-analyses of mortality surveys of farmers find excesses of several cancers, including connective tissue, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma and cancers of the skin, stomach, and brain, and deficits for total mortality, heart disease, total cancer, and cancers of the esophagus, colon, lung, and bladder. Meta-analyses of studies of individual cancers also support these findings, indicating a need to identify exposures and lifestyle factors that might account for this mortality pattern. Although cancer studies of other occupations that might have pesticide exposures in common with farmers show some similarities with observations among farmers, the overall patterns are quite different. This suggests that pesticides are not likely to fully explain the cancer and other disease patterns observed among farmers. Because exposures vary by type of farm operation, exposures for individual farmers can differ considerably. Studies in the future need to focus on the full range of exposures to fully understand the cancer pattern in farmers.},

In this paper we present the results of a dermal exposure assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia, where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment. The fractioning of the pesticide, in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure, was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology, using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate, and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method. We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management: preparation, application, and cleaning; analyzed three types of nozzles: one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing. Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk, three aspects have to be considered: (i) avoiding the modification of nozzles, which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure; (ii) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics, especially on the upper body parts; and (iii) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity.},

   abstract = {The high exposure risks of workers to herbicides in low- and middle-income countries is an important public health concern because of the potential resulting negative impacts on workers' health. This study investigated workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance as a risk mitigation measure; particularly workers who apply herbicides for Working for Water (WfW) – a South African invasive alien vegetation control programme. The study aim was to understand workers' low PPE compliance by analysing their risk perceptions of herbicide use, working conditions and socio-cultural context. Research methods included ethnographic observations, informal interviews, visual media, questionnaires and a focus group. Study results indicated that low PPE compliance persists despite workers' awareness of herbicide exposure risks and as a result of the influence from workers' socio-cultural context (i.e. gender dynamics and social status), herbicide risk perceptions and working conditions (i.e. environmental and logistical). Interestingly, teams comprised of mostly women had the highest compliance rate. These findings highlighted that given the complexity of PPE compliance, especially in countries with several economic and social constraints, exposure reduction interventions should not rely solely on PPE use promotion. Instead, other control strategies requiring less worker input for effectiveness should be implemented, such as elimination and substitution of highly hazardous pesticides, and altering application methods.},

The aim of this study was to assess pesticide exposure and frequency of cytogenetic damage in infant populations in agricultural areas of the department of Córdoba, Colombia. Urine and peripheral blood samples were taken from children living in the villages of La Ceibita (municipality of Cereté), Cabuya (municipality of San Carlos), Aguas Negras (municipality of Montería), Pelayito (municipality of San Pelayo), and the city of Monteria (control group). The work evaluated biomarkers of exposure to pesticides (atrazine urinary concentrations (ATZ) and its metabolites) and biomarkers of cytogenetic damage (micronucleus frequency (MN), nuclear buds, and apoptotic cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes). Measurable ATZ concentrations and/or its metabolites were recorded in the Pelayito, Aguas Negras, and Cabuya zones, which had higher MN frequencies, nuclear buds, and apoptotic cells than the control. Infant exposure to one of the more-often used pesticides in the agricultural areas evaluated and an increasing trend in the frequency of markers of cytogenetic damage in the groups of the agricultural areas, as compared to the control group, were evident.},

Therefore, there is extensive human exposure to this pesticide. Miral's mutagenic and genotoxic activities, however, are not known. In this study, such activities of the pesticide were evaluated using the Salmonella TA98/S9 test and the chromosome aberration assay in bone marrow cells of Swiss albino CD1 male mice. All doses tested with Salmonella in the presence of S9 mix (3.2, 16, 80, 400 and 2000 μg/plate) induced a mutagenic response that was three times the spontaneous mutation frequency. The mutagenic response without S9 was twice the spontaneous frequency. Based on a 4-day treatment (i.p.) of mice with Miral, the median lethal dose (LD50) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were 912.5 mg/kg and 730 mg/kg, respectively. A significant dose-dependent cell cycle delay (r2=0.85, p<0.01) was observed in bone marrow cells when mice were treated for 24 h with 73, 146, 219, 292, 365, 438, 511, 584, 657 and 730 mg/kg. Significant increases in mitotic indices (p<0.02) and chromosome aberrations (p<0.05) were induced in bone marrow cells, when mice were treated for 18 h with the highest dose 511 mg/kg. Our results indicate that Miral is a mutagenic compound in Salmonella and is capable of inducing chromosome aberrations at high doses in mice. Additional genotoxicity studies in farmers exposed to Miral should be conducted to determine the potential human health risk resulting from chronic low-dose exposures to this pesticide.

   abstract = {The "healthy worker effect," perhaps more accurately termed the "active worker effect," has been acknowledged by numerous investigators who have disregarded its significance. The healthy worker effect is expressed by SMRs (standardized mortality ratios) and influenced by the following three factors: (i) selection bias, (ii) improved socioeconomic status, and (iii) the conventional way of calculating SMRs. An examination of these three factors shows that selection for "employability" is probably the most significant factor for the healthy worker effect. For example, the shorter the observation, the smaller the SMR, and the stronger the healthy worker effect. Secondly, improved socioeconomic status as a result of employment has been shown to lower mortality. Last, although the SMR has the advantage of estimating relative risk in a small sample, it suffers many methodological pitfalls. It is recommended that at least three parameters be used to summarize mortality experience among the employed: (i) relative risk, (ii) attributable risk, and (iii) life expectancy.},

   abstract = {The "healthy worker survivor effect" describes a continuing selection process such that those who remain employed tend to be healthier than those who leave employment. In an analysis of exposure-response patterns in an occupational study, the healthy worker survivor effect generally attenuates an adverse effect of exposure. In practical terms, such attenuation will be more problematic when evaluating subtle rather than strong associations. The use of an internal referent does not guarantee elimination of this effect, since by definition, it manifests within an occupational cohort. Although documented over 100 years ago, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate method to control for the healthy worker survivor effect. Four methods have been proposed for its control: (1) restriction of the cohort to survivors of a fixed number of years of follow-up, (2) lagging the exposure to exclude recent exposure incurred by those who remained on the job, (3) adjusting for employment status as a confounder, and (4) treating the healthy worker survivor effect simultaneously as an intermediate and confounding variable by means of the G-null test or its extension, G-estimation analysis, using structurally nested failure time models. This paper reviews the concept of the healthy worker survivor effect and the four methods to control for it.},

In both sexes there was a significant age-related decrease in the number of nodes and of trabecular struts, corrected for section area. In females, there was also a significant age-related decrease in the node to free end ratio (P < 0.001), and the combined node-to-node and node-to-loop strut length, expressed as a percentage of total strut length (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in free end to free end strut length (P < 0.001). In males, the only additional age-related change was a significant increase in the cortex to free end strut length (P < 0.005). These results indicate that loss of trabeculae resulting in decreased interconnectedness of the normal trabecular bone structural pattern, plays an important role in agerelated bone loss in females. Removal of trabeculae also occurs in males but is less prominent, implying that trabecular thinning makes a greater contribution to age-related bone loss in males. © 1987.},

Regression analysis was performed using age at death as the dependent variable and OPD as the independent variable. The results of a "training set/test set" strategy to evaluate the performance of the histological age predicting model indicates that it provides reasonably reliable and accurate age estimates.

In the growing skeleton, there is a poor correlation between osteon numbers and age until the latter half of the second decade. As a result, there has been no histological aging method for use in subadults. The analysis of the rib cortex of 72 subadults ranging in age from 2 to 21 years has identified a series of developmental changes in the bone microstructure that can be used to estimate age. This qualitative method utilizes the systematic changes in rib cortical morphology to classify ribs into one of four age phases. This method can be applied to immature skeletons in forensic, archaeological, and paleontological contexts.},

Seventy-two Japanese males ranged from 43 days to 92 years old and 26 females ranged from 2 to 88 years old were used. The thickness of sections was adjusted at 50 to 70 μm by grinding with sand paper. The sections were not decalcificated. They were stained with Villanueva's bone staining powder and with thionin dye. Microradiographs of the sections were obtained by the soft X-ray apparatus. The area, maximum and minimum diameter, and perimeter of the perfect osteon and Haversian canal were measured. In addition, the type II osteon number, osteon fragment number, and area of triangle were also determined. All these parameters were examined by an image analyzer. The parameters of the osteon showed high correlation coefficient with age (|r|>0.77), while those of the Haversian canal were low (|r|<0.11). All parameters were subjected to multiple regression analysis for producing a multiple regression equation of age estimation. For the stepwise selecting method, the perimeter of osteon, maximum length of the Haversian canal and osteon fragment number were selected for the equation. Their multiple r2 and standard error of estimation were 0.8874 and 6.39, respectively. For the forward selection method, in addition to the above items, three parameters, the maximum length of Haversian canal, triangle area, osteon fragment number were selected. Their multiple r2 and standard error of estimation were 0.9484 and 4.884, respectively. Bone staining was useful to clarify the demarcation between osteon and fragment, leading to an increase in the accuracy of age estimation. However, the entire range from birth to 90 years was difficult to cover for precise age estimation. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

   abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility and low bone mass. Four clinical types are commonly distinguished. Schematically, type I is the mildest phenotype, type II is usually lethal, type III is the most severe form compatible with postnatal survival, and type IV is moderately severe. Although mutations affecting collagen type I are responsible for the disease in most patients, the mechanisms by which the genetic defects cause abnormal bone development have not been well characterized. Therefore, we evaluated quantitative static and dynamic histomorphometric parameters in tetracycline-labeled iliac bone biopsies from 70 children, aged 1.5 to 13.5 years, with OI types I (n = 32), III (n = 11), and IV (n = 27). Results were compared with those of 27 age-matched controls without metabolic bone disease. Biopsy core width, cortical width, and cancellous bone volume were clearly decreased in all OI types. Decreased cancellous bone volume was due to a 41%-57% reduction in trabecular number and a 15%-27% lower trabecular thickness. Regression analyses revealed that trabecular number did not vary with age in either controls or OI patients, indicating that no trabecular loss occurred. The annual increase in trabecular thickness was 5.8 microm in controls and 3.6 microm in type I OI, whereas no trabecular thickening was evident in type III and IV OI. Wall thickness, which reflects the amount of bone formed during a remodeling cycle, was decreased by 14% in a subgroup of 17 type I OI patients, but was not determined in the other OI types. The remodeling balance was less positive in type I OI than in controls, and probably close to zero in types III and IV. Surface-based parameters of bone remodeling were increased in all OI types, indicating increased recruitment of remodeling units. No defect in matrix mineralization was found. In conclusion, there was evidence of defects in all three mechanisms, which normally lead to an increase in bone mass during childhood; that is, modeling of external bone size and shape, production of secondary trabeculae by endochondral ossification, and thickening of secondary trabeculae by remodeling. Thus, OI might be regarded as a disease in which a single genetic defect in the osteoblast interferes with multiple mechanisms that normally ensure adaptation of the skeleton to the increasing mechanical needs during growth.},

Age graphs were derived from 126 specimens covering the age range from birth through 95 years. The best correlation with age by regression analysis was found in the osteon fragment number in the fibula (ρ = 9.74). The use of the regression formula for this factor permits the age to be estimated within ± ten years of the actual age 95% of the time. An alternative method utilizes a specially devised profile chart to estimate age from the age change graphs. When this method was checked on 56 additional specimens, 87.3% of the estimates were within ± five years of the actual age, and all estimates were within ± ten years. It was concluded that there are measurable microscopic age changes in the cortex of the major long bones of the leg that can be used to estimate the age of an individual with known accuracy over the entire range from birth to 95 years. This method can be applied to fragmented and incomplete skeletons as well as eroded archeologic skeletons, since only the mid‐shafts of leg bones are used.

   abstract = {The purpose of this analysis is to test the accuracy of microscopically and macroscopically derived ages on an excavated sample of human skeletons of known age at death from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London (18th and 19th century). Microscopic ages were derived on the basis of histology of the cross-section of the femur using techniques proposed by Kerley (American Journal of Physical Anthropology 23, 149-164, 1965; Kerley & Ubelaker, American Journal of Physical Anthropology49, 545-546, 1978) and by Samson & Branigan (in A. Boddington, A. N. Garland & R. C. Janaway, Eds, Death, Decay and Reconstruction Approaches to Archaeology and Forensic Science, Manchester University Press, pp. 101-108, 1987). Macroscopic ages were determined on the basis of pubic symphysis morphology using the methods proposed by McKern, Stewart & Gilbert (McKern & Stewart, Technical Report EP-45, Massachusetts Quartermaster Research and Development Command, Natick, MA, U.S.A., 1957; Gilbert & McKern, American Journal of Physical Anthropology38, 31-38, 1973), by Todd (American Journal of Physical Anthropology3, 285-334, 1920; 4, 1-70, 1921) and Brooks (American Journal of Physical Anthropology13, 567-597, 1955) and by Acsádi & Nemeskéri (History of Human Life Span and Mortality, Budapest: Akademiai Kiado, 1970). Results show that the Kerley technique is the most accurate microscopic age estimator for the Spitalfields sample, however it is not appreciably more accurate than the Acsádi and Nemeskéri pubic symphysis technique. The analyses also demonstrate that the three techniques for determining age from pubic symphysis morphology are each at least partially dependent on the age structure of the population upon which they were developed. The Todd/Brooks and McKern/Stewart/Gilbert techniques that were developed on populations with a young mean age are most accurate in the younger ages ranges, while the Acsádi & Nemeskéri technique which was developed on a population of older mean age is most accurate in the older age ranges. Correspondence between microscopically and macroscopically determined ages does not necessarily confirm the accuracy of either. It is also suggested that a combination of histological ageing and pubic symphysis ageing has the potential of producing more accurate results than either by itself. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

   abstract = {This report describes a new histologic method for determination of age at death, the latest in a series of studies that began with Kerley's pioneer presentation in 1965. The study population was collected from 328 documented individuals from an anatomy dissecting room in the United States, from two modern cemeteries in the Dominican Republic, and from autopsies performed in a Chilean hospital. Undecalcified thin sections 1.0 cm wide were made from specimens taken from the femoral midshaft directly opposite the linea aspera. Five 0.886 mm2 fields were located at the periosteal edge and photographed, mainly for purposes of defining the fields and providing a permanent record. Secondary osteons, type II osteons, osteon fragments, resorption spaces, and non-Haversian canals were recorded as number/mm2, and a 100-space grid was used to measure average percent of unremodeled, osteonal, and fragmental bone. Stepwise regression analysis of the measurements produced a series of regression equations for age estimation for females, males, and sexes combined. Most equations have a standard error of estimate of about 10 years, but the coefficients of determination (r2) range from 0.48 to 0.72. In practice, sex-specific equations gave better results than opposite-sex or nonspecific equations, mainly because males and females differed in the pattern of relations between osteons and osteon fragments with advancing age.},

We aimed to compare pectoral nerve (PECS) block with erector spinae (ESP) block in these patients in terms of analgesic efficacy and adverse effects. Methods: Sixty four American Society of Anesthesiologists' status I and II female patients between age 18 to 60 years scheduled for unilateral modified radical mastectomy (MRM) under general anaesthesia, were enrolled in this prospective randomised study. Patients in group I received ultrasound guided (USG) ESP block (20 cc 0.2% ropivacaine) while group II received USG guided PECS II block (25 cc 0.2% ropivacaine). General anaesthesia was administered in a standardised manner to both the groups. The various parameters observed included sensory blockade, duration of analgesia and any adverse effects. The primary outcome was the total morphine consumption in 24 hours. Results: The total morphine consumption in 24 hours was less in group II (4.40 ± 0.94 mg), compared to group I (6.59 ± 1.35 mg; P = 0.000). The mean duration of analgesia in patients of group II was 7.26 ± 0.69 hours while that in the group I was 5.87 ± 1. 47 hours (P value = 0.001). 26 patients in group II (PECS) had blockade of T2 as compared to only 10 patients in group I. (P value = 0.00). There was no incidence of adverse effects in either group. Conclusion: PECS II block is a more effective block when compared to ESP block in patients of MRM in terms of postoperative analgesia and opioid consumption.},

Recently, machine learning based methods have been widely proposed to solve the problem of bankruptcy prediction. However, the existing models do not consider that large amounts of instance-level labeled training data are hard to be obtained in practice. In this paper, we propose to address bankruptcy prediction problem from the perspective of learning with label proportions, where the unlabeled training data are provided in different bags and only giving the bag-level proportion of instances belonging to a particular class. Then, we contribute two novel prediction methods, termed as Bagged-pSVM and Boosted-pSVM, based on proportion support vector machines and ensemble strategies including bagging and boosting. The proposed methods can not only explicitly model the unknown instance-level labels and the known label proportions under a large-margin framework, but also improve the performance through introducing ensemble learning strategies. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate their efficiency and superiority on solving the problem of bankruptcy prediction.},

   abstract = {There has been intensive research from academics and practitioners regarding models for predicting bankruptcy and default events, for credit risk management. Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively, in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find SVM to lead to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sanchez, Garcia, Marques, and Senchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma, and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al.

The data, which reveal the true ratio between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies, are severely imbalanced and only contain a small fraction of bankrupt companies. Our solution to overcome this challenging scenario of imbalanced learning was to adopt three one-class classification methods: a least-squares approach to anomaly detection, an isolation forest, and one-class support vector machines for comparison with conventional support vector machines. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the financial attributes and identify those that are most relevant to bankruptcy prediction.

   abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are being applied to identification problems in a variety of fields, and in some areas are showing higher discrimination accuracies than conventional methods. However, applications of convolutional neural networks to financial analyses have only been reported in a small number of studies on the prediction of stock price movements. The reason for this seems to be that convolutional neural networks are more suitable for application to images and less suitable for general numerical data including financial statements. Hence, in this research, an attempt is made to apply a convolutional neural network to the prediction of corporate bankruptcy, which in most cases is treated as a two-class classification problem. We use the financial statements (balance sheets and profit-and-loss statements) of 102 companies that have been delisted from the Japanese stock market due to de facto bankruptcy as well as the financial statements of 2062 currently listed companies over four financial periods. In our proposed method, a set of financial ratios are derived from the financial statements and represented as a grayscale image. The image generated by this process is utilized for training and testing a convolutional neural network. Moreover, the size of the dataset is increased using the weighted averages to create synthetic data points. A total of 7520 images for the bankrupt and continuing enterprises classes are used for training the convolutional neural network based on GoogLeNet. Bankruptcy predictions through the trained network are shown to have a higher performance compared to methods using decision trees, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron, AdaBoost, or Altman's Z′′-score.},

Second, with selected default predictor covariates, we apply the discrete hazard model to examine the performance for the international market with time varying panel data over different prediction horizons. Our empirical study shows that for Japan market, three predictor variables, including Retained Earning/Total Asset, Total Debt/Total Asset and Current Liability/Sales are selected by adaptive-LASSO method. Such selection results are strikingly consistent for different sampling periods over different prediction horizons. The model using those three financial ratios alone demonstrates strong predictability in forecasting corporate default. For Japan market, the model with adaptive-LASSO selected variables shows superior out-of-sample predictive power over the Altman's Z-score model. On the other hand, for some Europe countries including UK, Germany and France, the equity ratio variable, Equity/Total Liability, is consistently selected across different prediction horizons, whereas, the rest of selected variables are mixed.},

Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts. In this paper, a unified framework for qualitative and quantitative bankruptcy analysis using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based ant-miner algorithm is proposed. Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository. The proposed method is successfully applied and the performance analysis prove that ant-miner method is better than existing classifiers namely Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in terms of various performance analysis factors. Furthermore, the proposed ant-miner model is found to be a more suitable method for bankruptcy prediction when compared to other traditional statistical and artificial intelligence techniques.},

   abstract = {Previous studies of bankruptcy prediction in imbalanced datasets analyze either the loss of prediction due to data imbalance issues or treatment methods for dealing with this issue. The current article presents a combined investigation of the degree of imbalance, loss of performance, and treatment methods. It determines which imbalanced class distributions jeopardize the performance of bankruptcy prediction methods and identifies the recovery capacities of treatment methods. The results show that an imbalanced distribution, in which the minority class represents 20%, significantly disturbs prediction performance. Furthermore, the support vector machine method is less sensitive than other prediction methods to imbalanced distributions, and sampling methods can recover a satisfactory portion of performance losses. Accordingly, this study provides a better understanding of the data imbalance issue in the field of corporate failure and serves as a methodological guide for designing bankruptcy prediction methods in imbalanced datasets.},

   abstract = {By present, many models of bankruptcy forecasting have been developed, but this area remains a field of research activity; little is known about the practical application of existing models. In our opinion, this is because the use of existing models is limited by the conditions in which they are developed. Another question concerns the factors that can be significant for forecasting. Many authors suggest that indicators of the external environment, corporate governance as well as firm size contain important information; on the other hand, the large number of factors does not necessary increase predictive ability of a model. In this paper, we suggest the genetic algorithm based two-step classification method (TSCM) that allows both selecting the relevant factors and adapting the model itself to application. Classifiers of various models are trained at the first step and combined into the voting ensemble at the second step. The combination of random sampling and feature selection techniques were used to ensure the necessary diversity level of classifiers at the first step. The genetic algorithms are applied at the step of features selection and then at the step of weights determination in ensemble. The characteristics of the proposed method have been tested on the balanced set of data. It included 912 observations of Russian companies (456 bankrupts and 456 successful) and 55 features (financial ratios and macro/micro business environment factors). The proposed method has shown the best accuracy (0.934) value among tested models. It has also shown the most balanced precision-recall ratio. It found bankrupts (recall = 0.953) and not bankrupts (precision = 0.910) rather accurately than other tested models. The ability of method to select the task-relevant features has been also tested. Excluding the features that are significant for less than 50% of the classifiers in the ensemble improved the all performance metrics (accuracy = 0.951, precision = 0.932, recall = 0.965). So, the proposed method allows to improve the advantages and alleviate the weaknesses inherent in ordinary classifiers, enabling the business decisions support with a higher reliability.},

   abstract = {Bankruptcy prediction has been a popular and challenging research area for decades. Most prediction models are built using financial figures, stock market data and firm specific variables. We complement such traditional low-dimensional data with high-dimensional data on the company's directors and managers in the prediction models. This information is used to build a network between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where two companies are related if they share a director or high-level manager. A smoothed version of the weighted-vote relational neighbour classifier is applied on the network and transforms the relationships between companies into bankruptcy prediction scores, thereby assuming that a company is more likely to file for bankruptcy if one of the related companies in its network has already failed. An ensemble model is built that combines the relational model's output scores with structured data and is applied on two data sets of Belgian and UK SMEs. We find that the relational model gives improved predictions over a simple financial model when detecting the riskiest firms. The largest performance increase is found when the relational and financial data are combined, confirming the complementary nature of both data types.},

   abstract = {The bankruptcy prediction research domain continues to evolve with many new different predictive models developed using various tools. Yet many of the tools are used with the wrong data conditions or for the wrong situation. Using the Web of Science, Business Source Complete and Engineering Village databases, a systematic review of 49 journal articles published between 2010 and 2015 was carried out. This review shows how eight popular and promising tools perform based on 13 key criteria within the bankruptcy prediction models research area. These tools include two statistical tools: multiple discriminant analysis and Logistic regression; and six artificial intelligence tools: artificial neural network, support vector machines, rough sets, case based reasoning, decision tree and genetic algorithm. The 13 criteria identified include accuracy, result transparency, fully deterministic output, data size capability, data dispersion, variable selection method required, variable types applicable, and more. Overall, it was found that no single tool is predominantly better than other tools in relation to the 13 identified criteria. A tabular and a diagrammatic framework are provided as guidelines for the selection of tools that best fit different situations. It is concluded that an overall better performance model can only be found by informed integration of tools to form a hybrid model. This paper contributes towards a thorough understanding of the features of the tools used to develop bankruptcy prediction models and their related shortcomings.},

For this purpose, a sample of 5,903 companies from the Spanish private health sector obtained from the database of the Iberian Balance Analysis System (SABI) between 2007 and 2015 was used. Results: The results show that the predictive model obtained with the AG presents greater accuracy, sensitivity and specificity than that proposed by Altman for private companies with both test data and all sample data. Conclusions: The most important finding of this study was to establish a methodology that can identify the optimized coefficients for the Altman Z-Score, which allows a more accurate prediction of bankruptcy in Spanish private healthcare companies.},

However, the performance of an ensemble solely relies on the diversity of its different components and, ultimately, on the algorithm that is used to create this diversity. It means that such models, when they are designed to forecast corporate bankruptcy, do not incorporate or use any explicit knowledge about this phenomenon that might supplement or enrich the information they are likely to capture. This is the reason why we propose a method that is precisely based on some knowledge that governs bankruptcy, using the concept of "financial profiles", and we show how the complementarity between this technique and ensemble techniques can improve forecasts.},

In response, our paper proposes an investor-facing dynamic model for characterizing business health by using a mixed set of techniques, combining both classical and "expert system" methods. Data for constructing the model was obtained from 198 multinational manufacturing and service firms spread over 26 industrial sectors, through Wharton database. The novel 4-stage methodology developed combines a powerful stagewise regression for dynamic predictor selection, a linear regression for modelling expert ratings of firms' stock value, an SVM model developed from unmatched sample of firms, and finally an SVM-probability model for continuous classification of business health. This hybrid methodology reports comparably higher classification and prediction accuracies (over 0.96 and ∼90%, respectively) and predictor extraction rate (∼96%). It can also objectively identify and constitute new unsought variables to explain and predict behaviour of business subjects. Among other results, such a volatile model build upon a stable methodology can influence business practitioners in a number of ways to monitor and improve financial health. Future research can concentrate on adding a time-variable to the financial model along with more sector-specificity.},

In this paper, a semi-parametric Cox survival analysis model and non-parametric CART decision trees have been applied to financial distress prediction and compared with each other as well as the most popular approaches. This analysis is done over a variety of cost ratios (Type I Error cost: Type II Error cost) and prediction intervals as these differ depending on the situation. The results show that decision trees and survival analysis models have good prediction accuracy that justifies their use and supports further investigation.},

Con- sumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to be an important determinant of fund flows. High performanceappears to be most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower consumers'search costs.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological association between chronic exposure to pesticides and recorded cases of human malignancy in Gaza Governorates during the years 1990-1999 was studied. The pesticide usage in Gaza Governorates was recorded in detail. It ranged from 216.9 to 393.3 t from 1990 to 1999, respectively. Banned and extremely hazardous pesticides are identified according to their carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Hospital cases of cancers in men and women were recorded. Each tumor type was grouped according to sex and age group from 0 to >65 years. Total cases recorded in males were 2277, with average annual incidence and age-adjusted rate/100000 was 53.2 and 96.8 respectively, whereas the total for females was 2458 cases, average annual incidence and age-adjusted rate/100000 was 59.7 and 105.3, respectively, over the same 10 years. Lung cancer, lymphomas, leukemia, cancers of the urinary bladder, prostate, brain, colon, stomach and liver were the most abundant among males, while breast cancer, leukemia, lymphomas, cancers of the brain, uterus, lung, thyroid gland and liver were the most abundant in females. Statistical analysis using correlation coefficients and P values showed highly significant positive correlations between the type of pesticide and cancer incidence for male, female and both sexes. Correlation coefficients and P values, respectively, for both sexes were: 0.992 and 0.000 for insecticides; 0.952 and 0.000 for fungicides; 0.812 and 0.004 for herbicides; 0.925 and 0.000 for nematicides; 0.992 and 0.000 for others; and 0.994 and 0.000 for all types of pesticides. In the densely populated agricultural areas, it is not possible to separate or differentiate between occupational and general public exposure. Consequently, the introduction of and heavy use and misuse of pesticides and other toxic substances in the Gaza environment is suspected to correlate with the growing incidence of cancer. Precise determination of the effects of chronic exposure is, therefore, urgently needed. Future legislation to stop and regulate the use of extremely hazardous compounds will be essential. Continuous records for chronic diseases and cancers are also required for future follow-ups and periodical risk-assessment evaluations. Hence, further epidemiological studies are needed with detailed exposure assessment for individual pesticides, taking measures to reduce risk into consideration.

   abstract = {Pesticides are used widely to control weeds and insect infestation in agricultural fields and various pests and disease carriers (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, rats, and mice) in houses, offices, malls, and streets. As the modes of action for pesticides are not species-specific, concerns have been raised about environmental risks associated with their exposure through various routes (e.g., residues in food and drinking water). Although such hazards range from short-term (e.g., skin and eye irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea) to chronic impacts (e.g., cancer, asthma, and diabetes), their risks are difficult to elucidate due to the involvement of various factors (e.g., period and level of exposure, type of pesticide (regarding toxicity and persistence), and the environmental characteristics of the affected areas). There are no groups in the human population that are completely unexposed to pesticides while most diseases are multi-causal to add considerable complexity to public health assessments. Hence, development of eco-friendly pesticide alternatives (e.g., EcoSMART) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques is desirable to reduce the impacts of pesticides. This paper was hence organized to present a comprehensive review on pesticides with respect to their types, environmental distribution, routes of exposure, and health impacts.},

   abstract = {The objectives were (1) to investigate potential environmental and occupational risk factors of non-Hodgkin lymphoid neoplasms (NHLN), and (2) to explore the relationships between risk factors and NHLN subtypes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The investigation was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 649 newly diagnosed NHLN cases (August 2003 through January 2008) and 1298 individually gender-age-matched patient controls at 25 hospitals in Shanghai. A 17-page questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, medical history, family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, and occupational and non-occupational exposures. Certain occupations of interest triggered a second questionnaire, which was occupation-specific and asked for more details about jobs, tasks, materials used and work environment. Exposure assessments were based on the questionnaires, on-site workplace investigations, data published in the Chinese literature, historical exposure measurements maintained by government health agencies, and expert opinions of a panel of local scientists who were familiar with workplaces in Shanghai. Risk estimates (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals) of individual risk factors were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. A number of potential environmental and occupational risk factors were associated with an increased risk of NHLN (all subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes; including home/workplace renovation, living on a farm, planting crops, raising livestock or animals, farm workers, fabric sewing and cutting workers, welders and sheet metal workers, masonry and plastering workers, product and chemical testing workers, toy manufacturing, agriculture industry, and beauty salon. Exposures associated with an increased risk of NHLN (all subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes included benzene, solvents, petroleum fuels, metals, insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and glues and adhesives. Multivariate models were used to adjust for potential confounding exposures, and several potential risk factors were subsequently eliminated. The results of the investigation indicated that some risk factors applied to all or most subtypes (e.g., insecticides and overall NHLN and subtypes of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms), while others to specific subtypes only (e.g., benzene and follicular lymphoma). Thus, some risk factors were subtype-specific. Th…},

Dado su amplia distribución y uso en diferentes industrias y en la agricultura, es muy frecuente que se presenten intoxicaciones accidentales por estos compuestos; además, como son sustancias que están al alcance de las personas, han sido empleadas como tóxicos en suicidios. El cuadro de intoxicación genera un síndrome clínico característico, con síntomas colinérgicos secundarios a la estimulación de los recep-tores de acetilcolina. El manejo médico de estos pacientes puede significar la diferencia entre la vida y la muerte, por lo que es importante que todo el personal de salud en los servicios de urgencias esté capacitado para reconocer el cuadro de intoxicación y manejarlo rápidamente en forma adecuada.

They have a large number of applications and utilities. They are used as oil additives, solvents, in the industry of dyes, varnishes, artificial leather, electrical insulation, waterproofing, plastic softeners, fungicides and others. Given its wide distribution and use in different industries and trades, organophosphorus compounds can be taken accidentally causing intoxication and can be used with the intention to commit suicide. The intoxication with organophosphorus compounds produces a characteristic clinical syndrome with cholinergic symptoms after stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. The medical management of these patients could make the difference between life and death, hence the physician and all health personnel in the emergency department should be able to recognize and manage poisoning symptomatology properly.},

Cohort studies (N = 461) were grouped (N = 181) so that specific populations could be traced from the earliest to the most recently published report, and we extracted observed and expected numbers of cases for each of 35 mortality and 23 cancer incidence endpoints. We then generated standardized mortality ratios or standardized incidence ratios and 95% confidence intervals, and undertook meta-analyses of subcohorts (for example, gender, latency, or duration of employment), as well as the entire cohort. With few exceptions, the observed cause-specific mortality and site-specific cancer incidences were reassuring: Overall, 10% fewer deaths were observed than expected. Fewer than expected deaths from all causes, cardiovascular disease, noncancer respiratory disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and external causes were observed, some or all of which may be attributed to a "healthy worker effect." Meta-analyses revealed weak to moderate excesses of lung and bladder cancers likely caused by occupational exposure to known human carcinogens. We also observed a 10-15% increase in lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers. Additional research is required to gain a more complete understanding of the potential role that methodology and environmental or occupational influences may play in these associations.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This analysis of the Agricultural Health Study cohort assesses the mortality experience of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses. Methods: This report is based on 52,393 private applicators (who are mostly farmers) and 32,345 spouses of farmers in Iowa and North Carolina. At enrollment, each pesticide applicator completed a 21-page enrollment questionnaire. Mortality assessment from enrollment (1994-1997) through 2000 provided an average follow-up of about 5.3 years, 447,154 person-years, and 2055 deaths. Results: Compared with the general population in the two states, the cohort experienced a very low mortality rate. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for total mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, total cancer, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and lung were 0.6 or lower for both farmers and spouses. These deficits varied little by farm size, type of crops or livestock on the farm, years of handling pesticides, holding a non-farm job, or length of follow up. SMRs among ever smokers were not as low as among never smokers, but were still less than 1.0 for all smoking-related causes of death. No statistically significant excesses occurred, but slightly elevated SMRs, or those near 1.0, were noted for diseases that have been associated with farming in previous studies. Conclusions: Several factors may contribute to the low mortality observed in this population, including the healthy worker effect typically seen in cohorts of working populations (which may decline in future years), a short follow-up interval, and a healthier lifestyle manifested through lower cigarette use and an occupation that has traditionally required high levels of physical activity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: To date, few large prospective cohorts have been conducted among agricultural population. AGRIculture and CANcer cohort is a large prospective cohort of subjects in agriculture studying cancer among active and retired males and females, farm owners and workers, living in eleven areas of France with a population-based cancer registry.
Results: Enrollment was conducted from 2005 to 2007 with a postal questionnaire. In January 2008, 180,060 individuals (54 % males, 54 % farm owners, 50 % retired) were enrolled. Mortality was studied until December 2009 (605,956 person-years with standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by comparison with the general population of the areas. Over this period, 11,450 deaths 6,741 in men and 4,709 in women were observed, including 3,405 cancer-related deaths. SMRs were significantly reduced for global mortality (SMR = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.67–0.70 in males and SMR = 0.71, 95 % CI 0.69–0.73 in females) and for death by cancer (SMR = 0.67, 95 % CI 0.65, 0.70 in males and SMR = 0.76, 95 % C: 0.71, 0.80 in females). These results were mainly explained by less frequent smoking-related causes of death (lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases). Nonsignificant excesses of death were observed only for rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis, suicides (in females), death for event of undetermined intent (in males) and breast cancer in male agricultural workers.
Conclusions: These first results are the first ones obtained in France based on a large prospective agricultural cohort showing that farmers would be in healthier condition than the general population.},

Previous studies have suggested associations of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with some of these chemicals; however, many studies have been limited in their ability to evaluate associations with lymphoma subtypes. We evaluated the use of eleven organophosphate and two carbamate insecticides in association with NHL in the North American Pooled Project, which includes data from case-control studies in the United States and Canada (1690 cases/5131 controls). We used unconditional logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders, including use of other pesticides, to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between these chemicals and NHL overall, and NHL subtypes, i.e., follicular (FL), diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and others. Ever use of malathion was associated with increased risk of NHL overall (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.14–1.81) compared with never users. Categories using tertiles of duration (<4 yrs., 4–12 yrs., and >12 yrs) also showed a significant exposure-response for increasing years of use of malathion and risk of NHL (OR<4vsUnex = 1.33 (0.88, 2.03), OR4-12vsUnex = 1.42 (1.02, 1.96), OR>12vsUnex = 1.55 (1.05, 2.28, p-trend < 0.01)). In addition, malathion use was statistically significantly associated with FL (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.11–2.27) and DLBCL (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.16–2.22) while there were no apparent associations with SLL or other subtypes, the p-value for heterogeneity across subtypes, however, was not significant. These results support previous studies suggesting an association between insecticide use and NHL overall, and provide new information on associations with NHL subtypes.},

This study assessed the effect of occupational exposure to specific chemicals on the risk of NHL. Patients and methods: Mailed questionnaires were used to obtain data on 1469 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed NHL cases and 5073 population controls between 1994 and 1997 in eight Canadian provinces. Data was collected on socioeconomic status, life-style, diet, occupation, and years of exposure to any of 17 chemicals. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived by logistic regression. Results: The study found an increased risk of NHL among males exposed to benzidine, mineral, cutting, or lubricating oil, pesticides, and herbicides. Compared with non-exposure to each specific chemical, the adjusted ORs were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.4) for benzidine, 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.5) for mineral, cutting, or lubricating oil, 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.6) for herbicides, and 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.6) for pesticides. Excess risk of NHL among females was associated with exposure to pesticides and wood dust. ORs increased with increasing exposure in years to benzidine and herbicides for males and with increasing exposure years to wood dust for females. These trends were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings in this study suggest that occupational exposure to specific chemicals plays an important role in the development of NHL in Canada.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To compare mortality by cancer sites and by other specific causes of death, and the prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers and non-farmers in Spain. Methods: Mortality by cause of death was calculated based on a longitudinal study with 10-years follow-up of 9.5 million men and 6 million women aged 20–64 years who were employed in 2001. The prevalence of risk behaviors was calculated from the 2001 National Health Survey in the 6464 employed men and 5573 employed women aged 20–64. The study subjects were grouped as farmers and non-farmers. For each cause of death, we estimated the ratio of age-standardized mortality rates, and for each risk behavior we estimated the age-standardized prevalence ratio in farmers versus non-farmers. Results: In men, the mortality rate for most cancer sites did not differ significantly between farmers and non-farmers, except for cancers of the lip, oral cavity, stomach, larynx and skin epidermoid carcinoma—which was higher in farmers—and cancers of the liver, pancreas and mesothelioma—which was lower in farmers. In contrast, farmers had a higher rate of mortality from most other diseases and from external causes of death. In women, farmers showed lower mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease, and higher mortality from external causes. The prevalence of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and obesity was higher in farmers than in non-farmers, except smoking and excessive alcohol consumption in women where prevalence was lower in farmers. Conclusions: Findings are different from those found in other studies. In men, greater exposure to the sun and the higher prevalence of risk behaviors in farmers could explain their excess mortality from some cancer sites and the other causes of death. However, other factors may be behind this excess risk of mortality from these causes, given that farmers did not show higher mortality from some cancers related to smoking. In women, no differences were observed in mortality rate for majority of causes of death between farmers and non-farmers.},

   abstract = {Exposure to pesticides represents a potential health risk for the general population and for agricultural workers in particular. Some researchers observed that occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The chromosomal translocation t(14;18) (q32;q21) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in NHL. The aim of this study was to detect the effects of pesticides on t(14;18) chromosome translocation in agricultural workers after short-term exposure. Fifty-two workers occupationally exposed to pesticides (fungicides and insecticides) and 52 non-exposed were recruited. The farm workers were on average exposed to pesticides for ∼3.7 h a day for 5 years. The frequency of BCL2-IGH t(14;18) translocation in workers occupationally exposed to pesticides was 10% (5 of 52) vs. 8% (4 of 52) in the control group. Overall, these data suggest that no signifcant association between occupational exposure to pesticides and an increased frequency of the chromosomal translocation BCL2-IGH t(14;18) in farmers was observed. However, further studies with a higher number of subjects exposed to pesticides are necessary to confrm this observation.},

   abstract = {To investigate the association between sun exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) by histologic subtypes and to explore whether or not vitamin D intake modify sun-NHL association, we analysed data from a population-based, case-control study conducted in Nebraska between 1999 and 2002. Information on sun exposure during the spring, summer, fall and winter was collected from 387 cases and 535 controls by telephone interview. We found no association between seasonal sun exposure and risk of NHL. Vitamin D intake was also not associated with NHL risk, nor does it modify the sun-NHL association. In contrast, total hours of sun exposure was inversely associated with the risk of NHL (odds ratio (OR) = 0.7 comparing >30 h/week to <14 h/week, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5-1.1). Sun exposure was associated with a lower risk of NHL among farmers (OR = 0.8, 0.5-1.3 for 14-30 h/week; OR = 0.6, 0.3-0.9 for >30 h/week; p-trend = 0.02), but not among non-farmers. Total hours of sun exposure was also inversely associated with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. In conclusion, our data suggest that total hours of sun exposure is associated with a lower risk of NHL, and the inverse association is not modified by vitamin D intake, is stronger among farmer, and may vary by subtypes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

They are traditionally divided into Hodgkin's lymphoma (which accounts for about 10% of all lymphomas) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is the topic of this Seminar. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma represents a wide spectrum of illnesses that vary from the most indolent to the most aggressive malignancies. They arise from lymphocytes that are at various stages of development, and the characteristics of the specific lymphoma subtype reflect those of the cell from which they originated. Since this topic was last reviewed in The Lancet in 2012, advances in understanding the biology and genetics of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the availability of new diagnostic methods and therapies have improved our ability to manage patients with this disorder.},

In the present study, we evaluated chlorpyrifos, and imidacloprid and α-cypermethrin as two representatives of green insecticides for their genotoxic activity. We conducted a 14-day treatment in extended human lymphocytes cultures using real life exposure relevant concentrations. An alkaline comet assay was used to detect primary DNA damage. Simultaneously, the effect on the specific action towards the TP 53 and c-Myc genes in terms of fragmentation and copy number were determined. Both genes are responsible for cell cycle regulation; thus playing an active role in carcinogenesis. Contrary to what was expected, imidacloprid showed the highest genotoxicity potential, irrespective of the fact that none of the insecticides induced a significant level of primary DNA damage at all tested concentrations. Similar, no significant effect towards the TP 53 and c-Myc gene was recorded. The present study indicates that low level use of chlorpyrifos as a conventional insecticide and imidacloprid and α-cypermethrin as green insecticides does not pose a risk to DNA in general, nor to the TP 53 and c-Myc gene structural integrity.},

Understanding the relationship between the immune system at the genetic level and malignant transformation is critical to reach its etiology. Objective: The aim of this work is to evaluate the expression of five immune related genes (PD-1, FOXP3, GrA, GrB and CD11c) in patients with diffuse large B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL). Materials and methods: This study was conducted on fifty patients with DLBCL and fifty sex and age matched apparently healthy subjects. The participants were subjected to these laboratory investigations: complete blood count, serum lactate dehydrogenase and β2microglobulin (β2M) levels and determination of PD-1, FOXP3, GrA, GrB and CD11c gene expressions. Results: The results of this study revealed that PD-1, FOXP3, GrA, GrB and CD11c gene expressions were significantly increased in DLBCL patients. Conclusion: Patients with DLBCL have variablePD-1, FOXP3,GrA, GrB and CD11cgene expressions levels, which are correlated with the overall survival (OS) indicating that they can be good predictors of outcome in these patients.},

An improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) with evolution and elimination mechanism was proposed so as to achieve the proper compromise between exploration and exploitation, further accelerate the convergence and increase the optimization accuracy of GWO. The biological evolution and the “survival of the fittest” (SOF) principle of biological updating of nature are added to the basic wolf algorithm. The differential evolution (DE) is adopted as the evolutionary pattern of wolves. The wolf pack is updated according to the SOF principle so as to make the algorithm not fall into the local optimum. That is, after each iteration of the algorithm sort the fitness value that corresponds to each wolf by ascending order, and then eliminate R wolves with worst fitness value, meanwhile randomly generate wolves equal to the number of eliminated wolves. Finally, 12 typical benchmark functions are used to carry out simulation experiments with GWO with differential evolution (DGWO), GWO algorithm with SOF mechanism (SGWO), IGWO, DE algorithm, particle swarm algorithm (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. Experimental results show that IGWO obtains the better convergence velocity and optimization accuracy.},

Incorporating a regime-switching mechanism, we establish a hybrid bankruptcy prediction model with non-uniform loadings in both accounting- and market-based approaches to reexamine the issue. We find the following. Creditors should increase the loading on market-based information when large and liquid corporations are considered. Conversely, for companies with incremental information involved in accounting reporting proxied by discretionary accruals, banks could emphasize accounting ratio-based variables more than they are already emphasized. Since managerial discretion in accounting numbers could serve as a tool to bring undisclosed information about the firm to the public, the weight on accounting-based information could be increased for firms with high information asymmetry. In addition, the loading on market-based (accounting-based) information should be increased (decreased) during periods of financial crisis, defined by negative gross domestic product growth.},

The results suggest a positive relationship between per capita GDP and innovation in both OECD and non-OECD countries, while the effect of R&D stock on innovation is significant only in the OECD countries with large markets. Although these results provide support for endogenous growth models, there is no evidence for constant returns to innovation in terms of R&D, implying that innovation does not lead to permanent increases in economic growth. However, these results do not necessarily suggest a rejection of R&D based growth models, given that neither patent nor R&D data capture the full range of innovation and R&D activities.},

   abstract = {Economic growth in the Eurozone has been lacklustre over the last two decades due to increased global competition from economic players in other regions, economic and financial crisis, and political uncertainties within the zone. To increase the global competitiveness of the region, the European Union launched the Europe 2020 Strategy to raise the level of entrepreneurship and innovation, which are purported to be key drivers of economic growth. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether this assertion is true. Thus, the paper investigates the Granger causal relationships among entrepreneurship development, innovation, and economic growth for a sample of the Eurozone countries for the period 2001–2016. Using a vector error-correction model, the study finds that in the long run, both entrepreneurship and innovation stimulate economic growth. In the short run, strong causal links exist but are not always uniform. The results reveal that Eurozone countries should indeed base their growth strategies on policies that promote innovation and policies that create incentives for entrepreneurship.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Brazil is one of the major pesticide consumers in the world. The continuous exposure to these substances may be etiologically associated with the development of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Objective: Estimate the correlation between the per capita sales of pesticides in 1985 (exposure) and NHL mortality rates between 1996 and 2005 (outcome), by Brazilian micro-regions. Method: In this ecological descriptive study, the per capita consumption of pesticides in 1985 was used as a proxy of the population exposure to these chemicals in Brazil. All deaths by NHL occurred in the 446 non-urban micro-regions, between 1996 and 2005, among individuals with ages between 20 and 69, of both sexes, were retrieved from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Micro-regions were then categorized into low, medium, high and very high pesticide consumption, according to the quartiles of per capita consumption of pesticides. NHL mortality rates and rate ratios for each quartile were obtained using the lowest quartile as reference. In addition, the Spearman's correlation coefficient between pesticide consumption and NHL mortality rates was estimated. Results: A moderate correlation between per capita pesticides consumption and standardized mortality rate for NHL was observed (r = 0.597). In addition, using the lowest quartile of pesticide consumption as a reference, the higher the quartile of pesticide consumption, the higher was NHL mortality risk: men - (second quartile - MRR = 1.69, CI 95% 1.68-1.84; third quartile - MRR = 2.41, CI 95% 2.27-2.57; fourth quartile - MRR = 2.92, CI 95% 2.74-3.11) and females (second quartile - MRR = 1.87, CI 95% 1.69-2.06; third quartile - MRR = 2.28, IC 95% 2.10-2.47; fourth quartile - MRR = 3.20; CI 95% 2.98-3.43). Conclusion: Our results suggest that pesticide exposure may play a role in the etiology of NHL. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

   abstract = {Several epidemiological studies show the association between organophosphate pesticides (OPs) and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), yet various research results remain controversial. To explore the hazard of OPs exposure to human health, three kinds of OPs (Terbufos, Malathion, and Diazinon) that are non-halogenated aliphatic compounds were included in the meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Web of Science Databases for articles published from 1985 to February 2017. The databases were also searched for eligible studies through a manual references search. The random-effect model was utilized to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs). A total of ten observational studies (five cohort, four case-control, and one nested case-control) were included in our meta-analysis, with a pooled OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.43) of Malathion, Terbufos and Diazinion. The general heterogeneity for OR was moderate (Ph = 0.032, I2 = 41.2%). The OR estimates in the subset analyses were utilized to compare the association between the three kinds of OPs and NHL; Terbufos (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.36) and Malathion (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.67) had a statistically non-significant relationship, whereas Diazinon (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73) was significantly associated with an increased NHL risk. Because immune dysfunction was thought to increase NHL risk, the toxicity levels in the immune system of the three types of OPs were compared. Malathion attacked immune cells via a direct effect and Diazinon disrupted the neuro-immune system, which involves the cholinergic system of lymphocytes via indirect immune damage, whereas an immunotoxic effect involving Terbufos was not reported. Overall, the present meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant association between Diazinon exposure and NHL risk.},

   abstract = {In Brazil, where the use of pesticide grows rapidly, studies that evaluate the impact of pesticide exposure on cancer incidence and mortality are very scarce. In this study, we evaluated the degree of correlation between pesticide sales in 1985 in eleven Brazilian states and cancer mortality rates during 1996-1998. Information of all cancer deaths occurred in men 30-69 years old from 1996 to 1998 were collected from National Mortality System. Single and multiple linear regression coefficients were obtained to assess the relationship between per capita sales of pesticides in 1985, specific-site cancer mortality rates (prostate, soft tissue, larynx, leukemia, lip, esophagus, lung, pancreas, bladder, liver, testis, stomach, brain, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) during 1996-1998, and several covariates. In addition, states were stratified into three groups according to tertiles of pesticides sales and cancer mortality rate ratios (MRR) were then calculated using first tertile as reference. Finally, a factor analysis was performed to reveal unapparent relationships between pesticide use and cancer mortality. Pesticide sales showed statistically significant correlation with the mortality rates for the cancers of prostate (r=0.69; p=0.019), soft tissue (r=0.71; p=0.015), leukemia (r=0.68; p=0.021), lip (r=0.73; p=0.010), esophagus (r=0.61; p=0.046), and pancreas (r=0.63; p=0.040). Moderate to weak correlations were observed for the cancers of larynx, lung, testis, bladder, liver, stomach, brain, and NHL and multiple myeloma. In addition, correlation between pesticide sales and specific-site cancer mortality rates was reinforced by multiple regression analysis. For all specific-sites, cancer mortality rates were significantly higher in the states of moderate (2nd tertile) and high (3rd tertile) pesticide sales, with MRR ranging from 1.11 to 5.61. Exploring hidden relationships between pesticide sales and cancer mortality in Brazil, through a factor analysis, revealed that affluence; public policies and lifestyle behaviors may explain almost 70% of the variance of the studied association. The results suggest that population exposure to pesticides in the 1980s in some Brazilian States may have been associated with selected cancer sites observed a decade later. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

A large proportion of patients exhibit negative smear tests despite active infection. The role of cytokines in the pathophysiology and clinical severity of PTB remains a controversial question. We evaluated the pattern of cytokines presents locally in patients with smear-negative PTB. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from patients with smear-negative PTB, as well as in those with other pulmonary diseases and controls, were performed by flow cytometry. ROC curve and a radiological severity scale were used to establish the potential diagnosis use and the relationship of the cytokine levels with disease severity, respectively. The levels of IL-6 were higher in the PTB (P = 0.0249) and pneumonia (P = 0.0047) groups compared to controls. Low to undetectable levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 were found in BALf, even after sample concentration using filtration columns and centrifugation. IL-6 levels measured in BALf could distinguish PTB patients or pneumonia patients from controls (AUC: 0.91, P = 0.002 and AUC: 0.86, P = 0.001, respectively), but not patients with PTB from those with pneumonia (AUC: 0.51, P = 0.86). IL-6 levels were related with the severity of PTB, as levels were higher in patients with higher radiological severity. These results confirm the importance of IL-6 in the immunopathology of smear-negative PTB.},

   abstract = {There has been intensive research from academics and practitioners regarding models for predicting bankruptcy and default events, for credit risk management. Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively, in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find SVM to lead to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sanchez, Garcia, Marques, and Senchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma, and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al.

Yet many of the tools are used with the wrong data conditions or for the wrong situation. Using the Web of Science, Business Source Complete and Engineering Village databases, a systematic review of 49 journal articles published between 2010 and 2015 was carried out. This review shows how eight popular and promising tools perform based on 13 key criteria within the bankruptcy prediction models research area. These tools include two statistical tools: multiple discriminant analysis and Logistic regression; and six artificial intelligence tools: artificial neural network, support vector machines, rough sets, case based reasoning, decision tree and genetic algorithm. The 13 criteria identified include accuracy, result transparency, fully deterministic output, data size capability, data dispersion, variable selection method required, variable types applicable, and more. Overall, it was found that no single tool is predominantly better than other tools in relation to the 13 identified criteria. A tabular and a diagrammatic framework are provided as guidelines for the selection of tools that best fit different situations. It is concluded that an overall better performance model can only be found by informed integration of tools to form a hybrid model. This paper contributes towards a thorough understanding of the features of the tools used to develop bankruptcy prediction models and their related shortcomings.},

This study examines the influence of environmental pesticide exposure on a number of neuropsychiatric conditions and discusses their underlying pathologic mechanisms. An ecological study was conducted using averaged prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral degeneration, polyneuropathies, affective psychosis and suicide attempts in selected Andalusian health districts categorized into areas of high and low environmental pesticide exposure based on the number of hectares devoted to intensive agriculture and pesticide sales per capita. A total of 17,429 cases were collected from computerized hospital records (minimum dataset) between 1998 and 2005. Prevalence rates and the risk of having Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and suicide were significantly higher in districts with greater pesticide use as compared to those with lower pesticide use. The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts. In conclusion, this study supports and extends previous findings and provides an indication that environmental exposure to pesticides may affect the human health by increasing the incidence of certain neurological disorders at the level of the general population. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The association between pesticide use and an increased suicide risk is a controversial issue. Previous studies have shown higher rates of suicide among agricultural workers and people living in small municipalities, but have not identified the causes of these results. Objective: To investigate the association between pesticide exposure and suicide rates. Methods: Crude suicide rates of a 15-year time series (1996-2010) were examined, followed by an ecological study using age-standardized suicide rates for the period 2006-2010. The unit of analysis was all 558 Brazilian micro-regions. Pesticide exposure was evaluated according to the proportion of farms that used pesticides and had reported cases of pesticide poisonings. The statistics were analysed using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors. Results: Among the age group that was analysed, the mean suicide rate was 6.4 cases/100,000 per year in the 2006-2010 period, with a male/female ratio of 4.2. The times series showed that there were higher suicide rates among people aged 35-64 years and among men aged 15-34 years. The ecological analysis showed that the suicide rates were higher in micro-regions with a higher proportion of farms run by 35-64 year olds, female workers and on farms with better economic indicators (higher farming income, level of mechanization and farm area). There was a positive association between the Catholic religion and suicide rates. Micro-regions with a greater use of pesticides, and with a high proportion of pesticide poisoning had the highest suicide rates for all three groups analysed: both genders, men, and women (p ranging from 0.01 to p< 0.001). Conclusion: This study reinforces the hypothesis that pesticide use and pesticide poisoning increase the suicide rates. However, due to the limitations of the study's ecological design, such as ecological fallacy, further appropriately designed studies are needed to confirm the causal relationships.},

   abstract = {Background: We evaluated the relationship between diagnosed depression and pesticide exposure using information from private pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study between 1993 and 1997 in Iowa and North Carolina. Methods: There were 534 cases who self-reported a physician-diagnosed depression and 17,051 controls who reported never having been diagnosed with depression and did not feel depressed more than once a week in the past year. Lifetime pesticide exposure was categorized in three mutually exclusive groups: low (< 226 days, the reference group), intermediate (226-752 days), and high (> 752 days). Two additional measures represented acute high-intensity pesticide exposures: an unusually high pesticide exposure event (HPEE) and physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning. Logistic regression analyses were performed relating pesticide exposure to depression. Results: After adjusting for state, age, education, marital status, doctor visits, alcohol use, smoking, solvent exposure, not currently having crops or animals, and ever working a job off the farm, pesticide poisoning was more strongly associated with depression [odds ratio (OR) = 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.74-3.79] than intermediate (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87-1.31) or high (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.87-1.42) cumulative exposure or an HPEE (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.33-2.05). In analysis of a subgroup without a history of acute poisoning, high cumulative exposure was significantly associated with depression (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.04). Conclusion: These findings suggest that both acute high-intensity and cumulative pesticide exposure may contribute to depression in pesticide applicators. Our study is unique in reporting that depression is also associated with chronic pesticide exposure in the absence of a physician-diagnosed poisoning.},

Objective: We sought to evaluate the existence of an association between pesticide use and suicide using data from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina. Methods: Via linkage to state mortality files and the National Death Index, we identified 110 suicides occurring between enrollment in the AHS (from 1993 to 1997) and 31 May 2009, among 81,998 cohort members contributing 1,092,943 person-years of follow-up. The average length of follow-up was 13.3 years. AHS participants provided data on pesticide use and potential confounders via self-administered questionnaires at enrollment. We evaluated several measures of pesticide use: use of any pesticide, ever use of 50 specific pesticides, cumulative lifetime days of use and intensity-adjusted cumulative lifetime days of use of 22 specific pesticides, and ever use of 10 functional and chemical classes of pesticides. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: After adjusting for age at enrollment, sex, number of children in family, frequency of alcohol consumption during the past 12 months, and smoking status, we found no association between prior pesticide use and suicide in applicators and their spouses. Results were the same for applicators and spouses together or for applicators alone and were consistent across several measures of pesticide use. Conclusions: Our findings do not support an association between moderate pesticide use and suicide.},

   abstract = {Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14–20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides. Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329. Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries—five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries—Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries— India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied—India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods. Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Funding None.},

Aims: To summarise published research in this area through systematic review and meta-analysis. Method: Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate a pooled risk of suicide across occupational skill-level groups. Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Elementary professions (e.g. labourers and cleaners) were at elevated risk compared with the working-age population (rate ratio (RR) = 1.84, 95% CI 1.46-2.33), followed by machine operators and deck crew (RR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.22-2.60) and agricultural workers (RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.19-2.28). Results suggested a stepwise gradient in risk, with the lowest skilled occupations being at greater risk of suicide than the highest skill-level group. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive meta-analytical review of suicide and occupation. There is a need for future studies to investigate explanations for the observed skill-level differences, particularly in people employed in lower skill-level groups.},

Methods We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis from 1995 to 2016 using MEDLINE and following the PRISMA guidelines. A pooled effect size of suicide risk among the population of interest was calculated using meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate whether effect size differed according to population or study characteristics. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity. Results The systematic review identified 65 studies, of which 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled effect size was 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30–1.68] representing an excess of suicide risk among the population of interest. Subgroup analysis showed that this effect size varied according to geographic area, with a higher effect size in Japan. The following study characteristics were found to contribute to the between-study variance: reference group, measure of effect size, and study design. Conclusions Our findings suggest an excess of suicide risk among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers and demonstrated that this excess may be even higher for these groups in Japan. This review highlights the need for suicide prevention policies focusing on this specific population of workers. More research is also needed to better understand the underlying factors that may increase suicide risk in this population.},

   abstract = {Background: Pesticides present widespread risks to human and environmental health, yet selection criteria for end-users that factor in differences in risk between compounds are scant. We developed a system to classify pesticide risks and hazards with respect to human and environmental health and produce a minimum (lower risk) pesticide list. Methods: We classified 659 pesticides by acute and chronic risks to human health (eg, respiratory and carcinogenic effects) and by environmental risks, including biomagnification and atmospheric ozone depletion and risks to aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, and pollinators. From this analysis, we produced a guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. The classification of highly hazardous and high-risk compounds has been tested in more than a million farm households in the tropics, and in US integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. The full classification, including the minimum pesticide list, has been used in management of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) throughout Africa and Asia. Findings: Our analysis developed a stand-alone guideline for selection of lower risk pesticides. When classifying pesticides in current use against the fall armyworm in Africa, our guideline identified chemicals that are effective and of lower risk to human and environmental health. We argue that a minimum (lower risk) pesticides list, which meets IPM needs, could be developed from our classification system. Interpretation: As far as we are aware, our analysis is the first to propose a method for implementing the idea of a minimum pesticide list and the first to outline lower risk candidate compounds. Currently accepted criteria for defining highly hazardous pesticides do not adequately protect human bystanders, aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, and pollinators.

Two-hundred and fifty-one patients with mean (SD) age of 30.4 (11.8) years, admitted with symptomatic poisoning and treated with atropine and supportive care, were followed up until death or hospital discharge. The admission pseudocholinesterase level of 818.8 (1368) IU/L indicated significant suppression of cholinesterase activity.

Methods: The study cohort was assembled using records of former government occupational health surveillance programs. The cohort was then linked to the Australian national registries of cancer and mortality and analyzed in comparison with the general Australian population. Results: Consistent with a healthy worker effect, we found no overall excesses in mortality or incident cancer. Non-injury-related causes of death were less than expected; however, non-intentional poisoning and suicide mortality were significantly elevated. All types of suicide were elevated, and firearm suicide deaths were significantly in excess. The suicides by poisoning were predominantly associated with pesticides, although other published research suggests this pattern is more often associated with developing countries. Conclusions: This study did not find evidence of a relationship between occupational pesticide exposure and cancer or non-injury-related mortality. However, accidental poisoning and intentional self-harm warrant further investigation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Methods Data of suicide deaths were retrieved from the Hellenic Statistical Authority and comparative mortality ratios were calculated. Occupational classification was based on the International Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) and the coding for Intentional self-harm (X60-X84) was based on the international classification of diseases (ICD-10). Results Male dominant occupations, mainly armed forces, skilled farmers and elementary workers, and female high-skilled occupations were seen as high risk groups for suicide in a period of 10 years. The age-productive group of 30-39 years in Greek male elementary workers and the 50-59 age-productive group of Greek professional women proved to have the most elevated number of suicide deaths.

We present a systematic review of the outcomes, locations, study designs, and methods of current studies on farmers’ mental health. In particular, this review aims to fill an important gap in understanding of the potential key risk factors affecting farmers’ mental health around the world. 167 articles on farmer mental health were included in a final systematic review using a standardized electronic literature search strategy and PRISMA guidelines. The four most-cited influences on farmers’ mental health in the reviewed literature respectively were pesticide exposure, financial difficulties, climate variabilities/drought, and poor physical health/past injuries. The majority of studies were from developed countries, most specifically from the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Comparative studies on the mental health of farmers and other occupational workers showed mixed results, with a larger portion identifying that psychological health disturbances were more common in farmers and farm-workers. Knowledge of farmer psychological disorder risk factors and its impacts are essential for reducing the burden of mental illness. Further research will be required on climate change impacts, developing country farmers’ mental health, and information on how to reduce help-seeking barriers amongst farmers.</p>},

   abstract = {Quantifying dermal exposure to pesticides in farming systems in developing countries is of special interest for the estimation of potential health risks, especially when there is a lack of occupational hygiene regulations. In this paper we present the results of a dermal exposure assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia, where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment. The fractioning of the pesticide, in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure, was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology, using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate, and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method. We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management: preparation, application, and cleaning; analyzed three types of nozzles: one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing. Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk, three aspects have to be considered: (i) avoiding the modification of nozzles, which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure; (ii) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics, especially on the upper body parts; and (iii) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity. © 2012.},

Materiales y Métodos Estudio multi-métodos y multinivel (individuo y comunidad), que incluyó métodos etnográficos, encuesta y medición de plaguicidas en agua y muestras humanas. Resultados Se describió el proceso productivo y se conocieron los principales factores de riesgo. Los plaguicidas son considerados el mayor peligro en el trabajo y en sus viviendas. Los trabajadores tienen precarias condiciones laborales y no están protegidos por el sis-tema de riesgos laborales. En las muestras de agua se encontraron azinfos-metil, endo-sulfán, b-BHC, bromofos-metil, bromofos-etil y 2,4-DDT. En la encuesta participaron 381 trabajadores de los cuales 12,9, 68 y 5,5 % tuvieron intoxicaciones leves, moderadas y se-veras, respectivamente. Los casos severos tenían menores niveles de escolaridad, menor nivel de afiliación al régimen contributivo del sistema de seguridad social y un mayor núme-ro tenía enfermedad cardiovascular, diabetes, herpes u otras infecciones virales. Conclusión Existen precarias condiciones laborales que favorecen la exposición a plaguicidas caracterizadas por la exclusión del sistema de riesgos laborales, po-breza y baja educación. Es urgente la inclusión de estos trabajadores al sistema de riesgos laborales y la mejora de las condiciones de vida. De esa manera se po-drán disminuir las prácticas inseguras en el manejo de plaguicidas.},

Our results show that exposure to the herbicide used in aerial spraying campaigns increases the number of medical consultations related to dermatological and respiratory illnesses, as well as the number of miscarriages. These findings are robust to the inclusion of individual fixed effects, which compare the prevalence of these medical conditions for the same person under different levels of exposure to the herbicide used in the aerial spraying program over a period of 5 years.

   abstract = {To assess potential exposure of bees to chemicals contaminants, pesticides and other management practices of local beekeepers and farmers, four Colombian regions were surveyed and residue concentrations were determined on some pesticides used and others banned for honey. A total of 61 honey samples were collected and analyzed during 2011. Residual levels of selected insecticides, fungicides and acaricides were determined by a multiresidue method, using gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detector/micro electron capture detector for the analysis and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector to confirmation. In this study, pesticide residues were identified in 32 samples (52.4% incidence), where organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were frequently found. The main detected compounds were chlorpyrifos (36.1% incidence), followed by profenofos (16.4% incidence), DDT (6.6% incidence), HCB, γ-HCH (4.9% incidence) and fenitrothion (1.6% incidence).However, the found concentrations found were low and just 4.9% of the samples exceeded the MRL concentration established in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 by European Parliament. According to the survey results, it is highly probable that the honey contamination produced in Colombia beekeeping regions under study, is caused by agricultural practices developed around of the hives installed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: The cholinergic system has an important role in mood regulation. Cholinesterase inhibitor pesticides (e.g. organophosphates) appear to increase depression and anxiety symptoms in the few existing animal and human studies. Human studies have not described such associations using biomarkers of exposure and studies among children are needed. Methods: We studied 529 adolescents (ages 11-17y) in agricultural communities in the Ecuadorian Andes (ESPINA study). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in a finger-stick sample. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the CDI-2 and MASC-2 (greater scores reflect greater internalizing symptoms). Models adjusted for age, gender, hemoglobin, income among others. Results: The median age was 14.38y and 51% were female. The mean (SD) of the following parameters were: AChE 3.7 U/mL (0.55), depression T-score 53.0 (9.4) and anxiety T-score: 57.6 (9.8). Lower AChE activity (reflecting greater cholinesterase inhibitor exposure) was associated with higher depression symptoms (difference per SD decrease of AChE [β [95% CI:]]: 1.09 [0.02, 2.16]), was stronger among girls (β = 1.61) than boys (β = 0.69), and among younger (<14.38y, β = 1.61) vs. older children (β = 0.57). The associations were strongest among girls <14.38y (β = 3.30 [0.54, 6.05], OR for elevated symptoms per SD decrease in AChE = 2.58 [1.26, 5.27]). No associations were observed with anxiety scores. Analyses of AChE change between 2008 and 2016 concurred with these findings. Discussion: We observed associations between a biomarker of pesticide exposure and children's depression symptoms. Lower AChE activity may create risk for depression in teenagers, particularly among girls during early adolescence.},

Both self-report measures and structured clinical interviews were used to assess mental health. The exposed cohort reported significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression when self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate mood, even when stressful life events, demographic and physical health factors were taken into account.

In this study, osteon population densities (OPDs) were determined from transverse sections removed from an area immediately adjacent to the sternal ends of 60 autopsy rib samples. Regression analysis was performed using age at death as the dependent variable and OPD as the independent variable. The results of a "training set/test set" strategy to evaluate the performance of the histological age predicting model indicates that it provides reasonably reliable and accurate age estimates.

This later age predicting model is recommended when both methods are applicable.},

   abstract = {The microscopic age changes that occur in human cortical bone were measured by counting the number of osteones, osteon fragments and non‐Haversian canals, and estimating the percentage of lamellar bone in four selected 100 power fields in the outer third of the cortex in ground sections from the mid‐shaft of the femur, tibia and fibula. Age graphs were derived from 126 specimens covering the age range from birth through 95 years. The best correlation with age by regression analysis was found in the osteon fragment number in the fibula (ρ = 9.74). The use of the regression formula for this factor permits the age to be estimated within ± ten years of the actual age 95% of the time. An alternative method utilizes a specially devised profile chart to estimate age from the age change graphs. When this method was checked on 56 additional specimens, 87.3% of the estimates were within ± five years of the actual age, and all estimates were within ± ten years. It was concluded that there are measurable microscopic age changes in the cortex of the major long bones of the leg that can be used to estimate the age of an individual with known accuracy over the entire range from birth to 95 years. This method can be applied to fragmented and incomplete skeletons as well as eroded archeologic skeletons, since only the mid‐shafts of leg bones are used.

   abstract = {The purpose of this analysis is to test the accuracy of microscopically and macroscopically derived ages on an excavated sample of human skeletons of known age at death from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London (18th and 19th century). Microscopic ages were derived on the basis of histology of the cross-section of the femur using techniques proposed by Kerley (American Journal of Physical Anthropology 23, 149-164, 1965; Kerley & Ubelaker, American Journal of Physical Anthropology49, 545-546, 1978) and by Samson & Branigan (in A. Boddington, A. N. Garland & R. C. Janaway, Eds, Death, Decay and Reconstruction Approaches to Archaeology and Forensic Science, Manchester University Press, pp. 101-108, 1987). Macroscopic ages were determined on the basis of pubic symphysis morphology using the methods proposed by McKern, Stewart & Gilbert (McKern & Stewart, Technical Report EP-45, Massachusetts Quartermaster Research and Development Command, Natick, MA, U.S.A., 1957; Gilbert & McKern, American Journal of Physical Anthropology38, 31-38, 1973), by Todd (American Journal of Physical Anthropology3, 285-334, 1920; 4, 1-70, 1921) and Brooks (American Journal of Physical Anthropology13, 567-597, 1955) and by Acsádi & Nemeskéri (History of Human Life Span and Mortality, Budapest: Akademiai Kiado, 1970). Results show that the Kerley technique is the most accurate microscopic age estimator for the Spitalfields sample, however it is not appreciably more accurate than the Acsádi and Nemeskéri pubic symphysis technique. The analyses also demonstrate that the three techniques for determining age from pubic symphysis morphology are each at least partially dependent on the age structure of the population upon which they were developed. The Todd/Brooks and McKern/Stewart/Gilbert techniques that were developed on populations with a young mean age are most accurate in the younger ages ranges, while the Acsádi & Nemeskéri technique which was developed on a population of older mean age is most accurate in the older age ranges. Correspondence between microscopically and macroscopically determined ages does not necessarily confirm the accuracy of either. It is also suggested that a combination of histological ageing and pubic symphysis ageing has the potential of producing more accurate results than either by itself. © 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

Histomorphometric age-at-death estimation methods developed for use on adults are based on the age-associated accumulation of osteons. In the growing skeleton, there is a poor correlation between osteon numbers and age until the latter half of the second decade. As a result, there has been no histological aging method for use in subadults. The analysis of the rib cortex of 72 subadults ranging in age from 2 to 21 years has identified a series of developmental changes in the bone microstructure that can be used to estimate age. This qualitative method utilizes the systematic changes in rib cortical morphology to classify ribs into one of four age phases.

In both sexes there was a significant age-related decrease in the number of nodes and of trabecular struts, corrected for section area. In females, there was also a significant age-related decrease in the node to free end ratio (P < 0.001), and the combined node-to-node and node-to-loop strut length, expressed as a percentage of total strut length (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in free end to free end strut length (P < 0.001). In males, the only additional age-related change was a significant increase in the cortex to free end strut length (P < 0.005). These results indicate that loss of trabeculae resulting in decreased interconnectedness of the normal trabecular bone structural pattern, plays an important role in agerelated bone loss in females. Removal of trabeculae also occurs in males but is less prominent, implying that trabecular thinning makes a greater contribution to age-related bone loss in males. © 1987.},

   abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility and low bone mass. Four clinical types are commonly distinguished. Schematically, type I is the mildest phenotype, type II is usually lethal, type III is the most severe form compatible with postnatal survival, and type IV is moderately severe. Although mutations affecting collagen type I are responsible for the disease in most patients, the mechanisms by which the genetic defects cause abnormal bone development have not been well characterized. Therefore, we evaluated quantitative static and dynamic histomorphometric parameters in tetracycline-labeled iliac bone biopsies from 70 children, aged 1.5 to 13.5 years, with OI types I (n = 32), III (n = 11), and IV (n = 27). Results were compared with those of 27 age-matched controls without metabolic bone disease. Biopsy core width, cortical width, and cancellous bone volume were clearly decreased in all OI types. Decreased cancellous bone volume was due to a 41%-57% reduction in trabecular number and a 15%-27% lower trabecular thickness. Regression analyses revealed that trabecular number did not vary with age in either controls or OI patients, indicating that no trabecular loss occurred. The annual increase in trabecular thickness was 5.8 μm in controls and 3.6 μm in type I OI, whereas no trabecular thickening was evident in type III and IV OI. Wall thickness, which reflects the amount of bone formed during a remodeling cycle, was decreased by 14% in a subgroup of 17 type I OI patients, but was not determined in the other OI types. The remodeling balance was less positive in type I OI than in controls, and probably close to zero in types III and IV. Surface-based parameters of bone remodeling were increased in all OI types, indicating increased recruitment of remodeling units. No defect in matrix mineralization was found. In conclusion, there was evidence of defects in all three mechanisms, which normally lead to an increase in bone mass during childhood; that is, modeling of external bone size and shape, production of secondary trabeculae by endochondral ossification, and thickening of secondary trabeculae by remodeling. Thus, OI might be regarded as a disease in which a single genetic defect in the osteoblast interferes with multiple mechanisms that normally ensure adaptation of the skeleton to the increasing mechanical needs during growth.

@article{Singh1970,
   abstract = {Studies were conducted to quantitate histological age changes in human bone cortex. Ground (undecalcified) and decalcified cross sections of mandible, femur and tibia were measured for: (1) number of osteons in two fields, (2) average number of lamellae per osteon, and (3) average Haversian canal diameter. These data were obtained from 59 subjects (52 males) ranging in age from 39 to 87 years. Multiple regression techniques were then utilized to estimate age at death from several combinations of these measurements. With age, the number of osteons per unit area of bone and the number of lamellae per osteon increased but Haversian canal diameter decreased. The number of lamellae per osteon had the least significant correlation with age. Multiple regression analyses indicated that in this age group age at death could be estimated to within six years of the true value in 95% of human males. Histological measurements of the mandible provided estimates that were consistently more accurate than those based on the two long bones. A monograph, prepared from mandibular measurements, can be used to estimate age at death between 40 and 80 years of age in the male human population. Significant sex differences were not noted and racial differences were not analyzed. It was concluded that, compared to existing morphologic methods, microstructure of bone cortex can be quantitated to estimate age at death more accurately. More extensive studies on race, sex and metabolic influences on age estimation from different bones would have important medico‐legal and anthropologic implications. The experimental approach utilized here should also be useful in diagnostic pathology and in ageing research. Copyright © 1970 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

   abstract = {This report describes a new histologic method for determination of age at death, the latest in a series of studies that began with Kerley's pioneer presentation in 1965. The study population was collected from 328 documented individuals from an anatomy dissecting room in the United States, from two modern cemeteries in the Dominican Republic, and from autopsies performed in a Chilean hospital. Undecalcified thin sections 1.0 cm wide were made from specimens taken from the femoral midshaft directly opposite the linea aspera. Five 0.886 mm2 fields were located at the periosteal edge and photographed, mainly for purposes of defining the fields and providing a permanent record. Secondary osteons, type II osteons, osteon fragments, resorption spaces, and non‐Haversian canals were recorded as number/mm2, and a 100‐space grid was used to measure average percent of unremodeled, osteonal, and fragmental bone. Stepwise regression analysis of the measurements produced a series of regression equations for age estimation for females, males, and sexes combined. Most equations have a standard error of estimate of about 10 years, but the coefficients of determination (r2) range from 0.48 to 0.72. In practice, sex‐specific equations gave better results than opposite‐sex or nonspecific equations, mainly because males and females differed in the pattern of relations between osteons and osteon fragments with advancing age.

   abstract = {The purpose of this study is to estimate the age of cadavers by histomorphometry of the femur. Seventy-two Japanese males ranged from 43 days to 92 years old and 26 females ranged from 2 to 88 years old were used. The thickness of sections was adjusted at 50 to 70 μm by grinding with sand paper. The sections were not decalcificated. They were stained with Villanueva's bone staining powder and with thionin dye. Microradiographs of the sections were obtained by the soft X-ray apparatus. The area, maximum and minimum diameter, and perimeter of the perfect osteon and Haversian canal were measured. In addition, the type II osteon number, osteon fragment number, and area of triangle were also determined. All these parameters were examined by an image analyzer. The parameters of the osteon showed high correlation coefficient with age (|r|>0.77), while those of the Haversian canal were low (|r|<0.11). All parameters were subjected to multiple regression analysis for producing a multiple regression equation of age estimation. For the stepwise selecting method, the perimeter of osteon, maximum length of the Haversian canal and osteon fragment number were selected for the equation. Their multiple r2 and standard error of estimation were 0.8874 and 6.39, respectively. For the forward selection method, in addition to the above items, three parameters, the maximum length of Haversian canal, triangle area, osteon fragment number were selected. Their multiple r2 and standard error of estimation were 0.9484 and 4.884, respectively. Bone staining was useful to clarify the demarcation between osteon and fragment, leading to an increase in the accuracy of age estimation. However, the entire range from birth to 90 years was difficult to cover for precise age estimation. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

   abstract = {Bone Histology: An Anthropological Perspective is a comprehensive look into the histological examination of hard tissues (bones and teeth). Because of their nature as hard tissues of the body, bones and teeth are of considerable importance for anthropological research. With the exception of forensic anthropology and the relatively rare cases of mummification, the physical remains of humans available to bioarchaeologists, paleopathologists, and pale- ontologists are limited to skeletal material. Fortunately, the same characteristics of hard tissues that lead to their persistence after death make them a storehouse of information about biological processes experienced during the life of the individual. Unlike for the soft tissues of the body, the activity of cells involved in growth and development, tissue main- tenance, and adaptation of hard tissues are encoded in their microstructure. Our ability to extract biologically important information from hard tissues has greatly improved with the understanding of bone provided over the last 5 decades by the work of researchers such as Amprino, Currey, Enlow, Frost, Johnson, and Marotti, and for teeth the work of Dean, Reid, Boyde, Beynon, Bromage, and Shellis. We now understand that although bone serves an important metabolic function relating to mineral homeostasis, its primary function is biomechanical. This edited volume arose from discussions by the editors and colleagues over the years and encouragement gained during a Forensic Histology Workshop orga- nized by the Department of Medical Education of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in July 2009. Through discussions at this workshop the authors fully appreciated the need for a comprehensive volume covering theoretical and applied aspects in histological analy- sis of skeletal tissue.

   abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major infectious diseases that seriously endanger people’s health. In Shandong province, the relationship between the level of economic development and TB incidence has not been studied. This study aims to provide more research basis for the government to prevent and control TB by exploring the impact of different economic factors on TB incidence. Methods: By constructing threshold regression model (TRM), we described the extent to which different economic factors contribute to TB registered incidence and differences in TB registered incidence among seventeen cities with different levels of economic development in Shandong province, China, during 2006–2017. Data were retrieved from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Per capita medical expenditure (regression coefficient, -0.0314462; SD, 0.0079305; P > |t|, 0.000) and per capita savings (regression coefficient, 0.0001924; SD, 0.0000566; P > |t|, 0.001) passed the significance test at the level of 1%.They are the two economic indicators that have the greatest impact on TB registered incidence. Through the threshold test, we selected the per capita savings as the threshold variable. In the three stages of per capita savings (<9772.8086 China Yuan(CNY); 9772.8086–33,835.5391 CNY; >33,835.5391 CNY), rural per capita income always has a significant negative impact on the TB registered incidence (The regression coefficients are − 0.0015682, − 0.0028132 and − 0.0022253 respectively. P is 0.007,0.000 and 0.000 respectively.).In cities with good economies, TB registered incidence was 38.30% in 2006 and dropped to 25.10% by 2017. In cities with moderate economies, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 43.10% and dropped to 27.1% by 2017.In poorer cities, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 56.30% and dropped to 28.9% in 2017. Conclusion: We found that per capita savings and per capita medical expenditure are most closely related to the TB incidence. Therefore, relevant departments should formulate a more complete medical system and medical insurance policy to effectively solve the problem of “difficult and expensive medical treatment”. In order to further reduce the TB incidence, in addition to timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment, it is more important for governments to increase investment in medicine and health care.},

   abstract = {Rapid expansion of the standardised approach to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment that is recommended by WHO allowed more than 36 million people to be cured between 1995 and 2008, averting up to 6 million deaths. Yet tuberculosis remains a severe global public health threat. There are more than 9 million new cases every year worldwide, and the incidence rate is falling at less than 1% per year. Although the overall target related to the Millennium Development Goals of halting and beginning to reverse the epidemic might have already been reached in 2004, the more important long-term elimination target set for 2050 will not be met with present strategies and instruments. Several key challenges persist. Many vulnerable people do not have access to affordable services of sufficient quality. Technologies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are old and inadequate. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious threat in many settings. HIV/AIDS continues to fuel the tuberculosis epidemic, especially in Africa. Furthermore, other risk factors and underlying social determinants help to maintain tuberculosis in the community. Acceleration of the decline towards elimination of this disease will need invigorated actions in four broad areas: continued scale-up of early diagnosis and proper treatment for all forms of tuberculosis in line with the Stop TB Strategy; development and enforcement of bold health-system policies; establishment of links with the broader development agenda; and promotion and intensification of research towards innovations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: Although poverty is widely recognized as an important risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) disease, the specific proximal risk factors that mediate this association are less clear. The objective of our study was to investigate the mechanisms by which poverty increases the risk of TB. Methods: Using individual level data from 198,754 people from the 2006 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) for India, we assessed self-reported TB status, TB determinants and household socioeconomic status. We used these data to calculate the population attributable fractions (PAF) for each key TB risk factor based on the prevalence of determinants and estimates of the effect of these risk factors derived from published sources. We conducted a mediation analysis using principal components analysis (PCA) and regression to demonstrate how the association between poverty and TB prevalence is mediated. Results: The prevalence of self-reported TB in the 2006 DHS for India was 545 per 100,000 and ranged from 201 in the highest quintile to 1100 in the lowest quintile. Among those in the poorest population, the PAFs for low body mass index (BMI) and indoor air pollution were 34.2% and 28.5% respectively. The PCA analysis also showed that low BMI had the strongest mediating effect on the association between poverty and prevalent TB (12%, p = 0.019). Conclusion: TB control strategies should be targeted to the poorest populations that are most at risk, and should address the most important determinants of disease-specifically low BMI and indoor air pollution. © 2012 Oxlade, Murray.},

We tested whether alternative social protection programmes have affected tuberculosis case notifications, prevalence, and mortality, and case detection and treatment success rates in 21 European countries from 1995 to 2012. Methods: We obtained tuberculosis case notification data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's 2014 European Surveillance System database. We also obtained data for case detection, treatment success, prevalence, and mortality rates from WHO's 2014 tuberculosis database. We extracted data for 21 countries between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2012. Social protection data were from EuroStat, 2014 edition. We used multivariate cross-national statistical models to quantify the association of differing types of social protection programmes with tuberculosis outcomes. All analyses were prespecified. Findings: After we controlled for economic output, public health spending, and country fixed effects, each US$100 increase in social protection spending was associated with a decrease per 100 000 population in the number of tuberculosis case notifications of -1·53% (95% CI -0·28 to -2·79; p=0·0191), estimated incidence rates of -1·70% (-0·30 to -3·11; p=0·0201), non-HIV-related tuberculosis mortality rate of -2·74% (-0·66 to -4·82; p=0·0125), and all-cause tuberculosis mortality rate of -3·08% (-0·73 to -5·43; p=0·0127). We noted no relation between increased social spending and tuberculosis prevalence (-1·50% [-3·10 to 0·10] per increase of $100; p=0·0639) or smear-positive treatment success rates (-0·079% [-0·18 to 0·34] per increase of $100; p=0·5235) or case detection (-0·59% [-1·31 to 0·14] per increase of $100; p=0·1066). Old age pension expenditure seemed to have the strongest association with reductions in tuberculosis case notification rates for those aged 65 years or older (-3·87% [-0·95 to -6·78]; p=0·0137). Interpretation: Investment in social protection programmes are likely to provide an effective complement to tuberculosis prevention and treatment programmes, especially for vulnerable groups.},

These data were incorporated into a negative binomial regression model with the rate of pediatric tuberculosis disease in each census tract as an outcome variable. Disease rates were obtained by geocoding reported cases. Subsections of the state (San Francisco and Los Angeles) were examined independently. Results. Census tracts with lower median incomes, more racial/ethnic minorities, and more immigrants had higher rates of pediatric tuberculosis. Other frequently cited risk factors such as overcrowding and unemployment were not associated with increased disease after adjusting for other measures. Risks were comparable across regions, but subtle differences were noted. Conclusions. The techniques used in this work provide a way to examine a disease within its social context. The results confirmed that tuberculosis in California continues to be a disease of poverty and racial/ethnic minorities.},

In Shandong province, the relationship between the level of economic development and TB incidence has not been studied. This study aims to provide more research basis for the government to prevent and control TB by exploring the impact of different economic factors on TB incidence. Methods: By constructing threshold regression model (TRM), we described the extent to which different economic factors contribute to TB registered incidence and differences in TB registered incidence among seventeen cities with different levels of economic development in Shandong province, China, during 2006–2017. Data were retrieved from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Per capita medical expenditure (regression coefficient, -0.0314462; SD, 0.0079305; P > |t|, 0.000) and per capita savings (regression coefficient, 0.0001924; SD, 0.0000566; P > |t|, 0.001) passed the significance test at the level of 1%.They are the two economic indicators that have the greatest impact on TB registered incidence. Through the threshold test, we selected the per capita savings as the threshold variable. In the three stages of per capita savings (<9772.8086 China Yuan(CNY); 9772.8086–33,835.5391 CNY; >33,835.5391 CNY), rural per capita income always has a significant negative impact on the TB registered incidence (The regression coefficients are − 0.0015682, − 0.0028132 and − 0.0022253 respectively. P is 0.007,0.000 and 0.000 respectively.).In cities with good economies, TB registered incidence was 38.30% in 2006 and dropped to 25.10% by 2017. In cities with moderate economies, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 43.10% and dropped to 27.1% by 2017.In poorer cities, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 56.30% and dropped to 28.9% in 2017. Conclusion: We found that per capita savings and per capita medical expenditure are most closely related to the TB incidence. Therefore, relevant departments should formulate a more complete medical system and medical insurance policy to effectively solve the problem of “difficult and expensive medical treatment”. In order to further reduce the TB incidence, in addition to timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment, it is more important for governments to increase investment in medicine and health care.},

   abstract = {Background: The End TB Strategy places great emphasis on increasing social protection and poverty alleviation programmes. However, the role of social protection on controlling tuberculosis has not been examined fully. We analysed the association between social protection spending and tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality globally. Methods: We used publicly available data from WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme for tuberculosis burden in terms of yearly incidence, prevalence, and mortality per 100 000 people, and social protection data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), expressed as the percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) spent on social protection programmes (excluding health). Data from ILO were from 146 countries covering the years between 2000 and 2012. We used descriptive assessments to examine levels of social protection and tuberculosis burden for each country, then used these assessments to inform our fully adjusted multivariate regression models. Our models controlled for economic output, adult HIV prevalence, health expenditure, population density, the percentage of foreign-born residents, and the strength of the national tuberculosis treatment programme, and also incorporated a country-level fixed effect to adjust for clustering of datapoints within countries. Findings: Overall, social protection spending levels were inversely associated with tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality. For a country spending 0% of their GDP on social protection, moving to spending 1% of their GDP was associated with a change of -18·33 per 100 000 people (95% CI -32·10 to -4·60; p=0·009) in prevalence, -8·16 per 100 000 people (-16·00 to -0·27; p=0·043) in incidence, and -5·48 per 100 000 people (-9·34 to -1·62; p=0·006) in mortality. This association was mitigated at higher levels of social protection spending, and lost significance when more than 11% of GDP was spent. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that investments in social protection could contribute to a reduced tuberculosis burden, especially in countries that are investing a small proportion of their GDP in this area. However, further research is needed to support these ecological associations.

   abstract = {Background: Nationally representative tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys provide invaluable empirical measurements of TB burden but are a massive and complex undertaking. Therefore, methods that capitalize on data from these surveys are both attractive and imperative. The aim of this study was to use existing TB prevalence estimates to develop and validate an ecological predictive statistical model to indirectly estimate TB prevalence in low- and middle-income countries without survey data. Methods: We included national and subnational estimates from 30 nationally representative surveys and 2 district-level surveys in India, resulting in 50 data points for model development (training set). Ecological predictors included TB notification and programmatic data, co-morbidities and socio-environmental factors extracted from online data repositories. A random-effects multivariable binomial regression model was developed using the training set and was used to predict bacteriologically confirmed TB prevalence in 63 low- and middle-income countries across Africa and Asia in 2015. Results: Out of the 111 ecological predictors considered, 14 were retained for model building (due to incompleteness or collinearity). The final model retained for predictions included five predictors: continent, percentage retreated cases out of all notified, all forms TB notification rates per 100 000 population, population density and proportion of the population under the age of 15. Cross-fold validations in the training set showed very good average fit (R-sq ¼ 0.92). Conclusion: Predictive ecological modelling is a useful complementary approach to indirectly estimating TB burden and can be considered alongside other methods in countries with limited robust empirical measurements of TB among the general population.},

Settings The study was based on new patients with tuberculosis and epidemiological/operational variables of the disease from the Brazilian National Information System for Notifiable Diseases and the Mortality Information System. We also analysed socioeconomic and demographic variables. Participants The units of analysis were the Brazilian municipalities, which in 2015 numbered 5570 but 5 were excluded due to the absence of socioeconomic information. Primary outcome Tuberculosis incidence rate in 2015. Data analysis We evaluated as independent variables the socioeconomic (2010), epidemiological and operational healthcare indicators of tuberculosis (2014 or 2015) using negative binomial regression. Municipalities were clustered by the k-means method considering the variables identified in multiple regression models. Results We identified two clusters according to socioeconomic variables associated with the tuberculosis incidence rate (unemployment rate and household crowding): a higher socioeconomic scenario (n=3482 municipalities) with a mean tuberculosis incidence rate of 16.3/100 000 population and a lower socioeconomic scenario (2083 municipalities) with a mean tuberculosis incidence rate of 22.1/100 000 population. In a second stage of clusterisation, we defined four subgroups in each of the socioeconomic scenarios using epidemiological and operational variables such as tuberculosis mortality rate, AIDS case detection rate and proportion of vulnerable population among patients with tuberculosis. Some of the subscenarios identified were characterised by fragility in their information systems, while others were characterised by the concentration of tuberculosis cases in key populations. Conclusion Clustering municipalities in scenarios allowed us to classify them according to the socioeconomic, epidemiological and operational variables associated with tuberculosis risk. This classification can support targeted evidence-based decisions such as monitoring data quality for improving the information system or establishing integrative social protective policies for key populations.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the economic burden of tuberculosis (TB) in Denmark,. Methods: 8,433 Danish TB-patients (1998-2010) were matched with 33,707 controls by age, gender, civil status and geography. Health-related costs (health system contacts and -procedures, medications) and socio-economic parameters (foregone earnings and social transfer expenses) were calculated on data from national databases. The same information was obtained for 3,485 spouses of TB-patients, and 17,403 controls. Results: Health-related costs were higher for cases throughout the period. Before diagnosis, cases posed € 1,180 more health costs per year than controls. Excess health costs in the 2 years around diagnosing and treating TB were € 10,509. Cases received an average excess public transfer income of € 3,345 before vs. € 3,121 after diagnosis. Average employment income deficiency was € 11,635 before vs. € 13,885 after diagnosis, but the increasing difference showed a linear shape throughout the period. Spouses also had lower income, more social transfer, and posed higher health-related costs than matched controls. Conclusion: We estimate the direct costs per TB patient to be €10,509. TB patients and their households are characterized by increasingly lower employment income, lower employment rate, and higher dependency on public transfer, but the socio/economic deterioration is rather a risk factor for TB than a direct consequence of the disease.},

   abstract = {Background: Progress in tuberculosis control worldwide, including achievement of 2015 global targets, requires adequate financing sustained for many years. WHO began yearly monitoring of tuberculosis funding in 2002. We used data reported to WHO to analyse tuberculosis funding from governments and international donors (in real terms, constant 2011 US$) and associated progress in tuberculosis control in low-income and middle-income countries between 2002 and 2011. We then assessed funding needed to 2015 and how this funding could be mobilised. Methods: We included low-income and middle-income countries that reported data about financing for tuberculosis to WHO and had at least three observations between 2002 and 2011. When data were missing for specific country-year combinations, we imputed the missing data. We aggregated country-specific results for eight country groups defined according to income level, political and economic profile, geography, and tuberculosis burden. We compared absolute changes in total funding with those in the total number of patients successfully treated and did cross-country comparisons of cost per successfully treated patient relative to gross domestic product. We estimated funding needs for tuberculosis care and control for all low-income and middle-income countries to 2015, and compared these needs with domestic funding that could be mobilised. Findings: Total funding grew from $1·7 billion in 2002 to $4·4 billion in 2011. It was mostly spent on diagnosis and treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. 43 million patients were successfully treated, usually for $100-500 per person in countries with high burdens of tuberculosis. Domestic funding rose from $1·5 billion to $3·9 billion per year, mostly in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), which collectively account for 45% of global cases, where national contributions accounted for more than 95% of yearly funding. Donor funding increased from $0·2 billion in 2002 to $0·5 billion in 2011, and accounted for a mean of 39% of funding in the 17 countries with the highest burdens (excluding BRICS) and a mean of 67% in low-income countries by 2011. BRICS and upper middle-income countries could mobilise almost all of their funding needs to 2015 from domestic sources. A full response to the tuberculosis epidemic to 2015, including investments to tackle multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, will require international donor funding of $1·6-2·3 billion each year. Interpretation: Funding for tuberculosis control increased substantially between 2002 and 2011, resulting in impressive and cost-effective gains. The increasing self-sufficiency of many countries, including BRICS, which account for almost half the world's tuberculosis cases, is a success story for control of tuberculosis. Nonetheless, international donor funding remains crucial in many countries and more is needed to achieve 2015 targets. Funding: None. © 2013 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier.},

This study is an attempt to examine whether DAH targeted specifically to malaria, HIV and tuberculosis (TB) is associated with changes in malaria, HIV and TB mortality, respectively. A dataset of DAH targeted to malaria, HIV and TB and corresponding malaria-, HIV- and TB-specific mortality was compiled for 120 low- and middle-income countries. Regression analysis was performed using country and time-period fixed effects and control variables. While malaria and HIV DAH were associated with reductions in malaria and HIV mortality, respectively, TB DAH was not significantly associated with reductions in TB mortality. Estimates were consistent in various sensitivity analyses, including generalized method of moments estimation, addition of extra controls and analysis of a multiply imputed dataset. In conclusion, targeted DAH is associated with reduction of HIV and malaria mortality on a national level.},

   abstract = {Background: COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to cases overburdening the health system or response measures limiting usual programmatic activities. We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. Methods: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. Interpretation: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

   abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major infectious diseases that seriously endanger people’s health. In Shandong province, the relationship between the level of economic development and TB incidence has not been studied. This study aims to provide more research basis for the government to prevent and control TB by exploring the impact of different economic factors on TB incidence. Methods: By constructing threshold regression model (TRM), we described the extent to which different economic factors contribute to TB registered incidence and differences in TB registered incidence among seventeen cities with different levels of economic development in Shandong province, China, during 2006–2017. Data were retrieved from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Per capita medical expenditure (regression coefficient, -0.0314462; SD, 0.0079305; P > |t|, 0.000) and per capita savings (regression coefficient, 0.0001924; SD, 0.0000566; P > |t|, 0.001) passed the significance test at the level of 1%.They are the two economic indicators that have the greatest impact on TB registered incidence. Through the threshold test, we selected the per capita savings as the threshold variable. In the three stages of per capita savings (<9772.8086 China Yuan(CNY); 9772.8086–33,835.5391 CNY; >33,835.5391 CNY), rural per capita income always has a significant negative impact on the TB registered incidence (The regression coefficients are − 0.0015682, − 0.0028132 and − 0.0022253 respectively. P is 0.007,0.000 and 0.000 respectively.).In cities with good economies, TB registered incidence was 38.30% in 2006 and dropped to 25.10% by 2017. In cities with moderate economies, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 43.10% and dropped to 27.1% by 2017.In poorer cities, TB registered incidence peaked in 2008 at 56.30% and dropped to 28.9% in 2017. Conclusion: We found that per capita savings and per capita medical expenditure are most closely related to the TB incidence. Therefore, relevant departments should formulate a more complete medical system and medical insurance policy to effectively solve the problem of “difficult and expensive medical treatment”. In order to further reduce the TB incidence, in addition to timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment, it is more important for governments to increase investment in medicine and health care.},

   abstract = {Background: The End TB Strategy places great emphasis on increasing social protection and poverty alleviation programmes. However, the role of social protection on controlling tuberculosis has not been examined fully. We analysed the association between social protection spending and tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality globally. Methods: We used publicly available data from WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme for tuberculosis burden in terms of yearly incidence, prevalence, and mortality per 100 000 people, and social protection data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), expressed as the percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) spent on social protection programmes (excluding health). Data from ILO were from 146 countries covering the years between 2000 and 2012. We used descriptive assessments to examine levels of social protection and tuberculosis burden for each country, then used these assessments to inform our fully adjusted multivariate regression models. Our models controlled for economic output, adult HIV prevalence, health expenditure, population density, the percentage of foreign-born residents, and the strength of the national tuberculosis treatment programme, and also incorporated a country-level fixed effect to adjust for clustering of datapoints within countries. Findings: Overall, social protection spending levels were inversely associated with tuberculosis prevalence, incidence, and mortality. For a country spending 0% of their GDP on social protection, moving to spending 1% of their GDP was associated with a change of -18·33 per 100 000 people (95% CI -32·10 to -4·60; p=0·009) in prevalence, -8·16 per 100 000 people (-16·00 to -0·27; p=0·043) in incidence, and -5·48 per 100 000 people (-9·34 to -1·62; p=0·006) in mortality. This association was mitigated at higher levels of social protection spending, and lost significance when more than 11% of GDP was spent. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that investments in social protection could contribute to a reduced tuberculosis burden, especially in countries that are investing a small proportion of their GDP in this area. However, further research is needed to support these ecological associations.

   abstract = {The main thrust of the World Health Organization's global tuberculosis (TB) control strategy is to ensure effective and equitable delivery of quality assured diagnosis and treatment of TB. Options for including preventive efforts have not yet been fully considered. This paper presents a narrative review of the historical and recent progress in TB control and the role of TB risk factors and social determinants. The review was conducted with a view to assess the prospects of effectively controlling TB under the current strategy, and the potential to increase epidemiological impact through additional preventive interventions. The review suggests that, while the current strategy is effective in curing patients and saving lives, the epidemiological impact has so far been less than predicted. In order to reach long-term epidemiological targets for global TB control, additional interventions to reduce peoples' vulnerability for TB may therefore be required. Risk factors that seem to be of importance at the population level include poor living and working conditions associated with high risk of TB transmission, and factors that impair the host's defence against TB infection and disease, such as HIV infection, malnutrition, smoking, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and indoor air pollution. Preventive interventions may target these factors directly or via their underlying social determinants. The identification of risk groups also helps to target strategies for early detection of people in need of TB treatment. More research is needed on the suitability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these intervention options. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Method: this is an analytical and ecological study that was developed from new cases in residents of an endemic municipality in the North Region of Brazil.

The Adapted Living Conditions Index was obtained by factor analysis and its association with the occurrence of the disease was analyzed by means of the chi-square test. The type I error was set at 0.05. Kernel estimation was used to describe the density of tuberculosis in each census sector. Results: the incidence coefficient was 97.5/100,000 inhabitants. The data showed a statistically significant association between the number of cases and socioeconomic class, with the fact that belonging to the highest economic class reduces the chance of the disease occurring. The thematic maps showed that tuberculosis was distributed in a heterogeneous way with a concentration in the Southern region of the municipality. Conclusion: tuberculosis, associated with precarious living conditions, reinforces the importance of discussion on social determinants in the healthdisease process to subsidize equitable health actions in risk areas, upon a context of vulnerability.},

Objective: To explore the inequalities in ARI mortality rates in under-5, according to socioeconomic characteristics. Materials and methods: We conducted an ecological analysis to study inequalities at municipal level due to ARI mortality in children under 5 years. The data were obtained from official death records of the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística. The analysis of inequalities in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) included: 1) Classification of the population in different socio-economic strata, and 2) measurement of the degree of inequality. We used the ARI-U5MR as an outcome measurement. The mortality rates were estimated at national and municipal levels for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013. Rate ratios, rates differences, and concentration curves were calculated to observe the inequalities. Results: A total of 18,012 children under 5 years died by ARI in Colombia from 2000 to 2013. ARI- U5MR was greater in boys than in girls. During this period, an increase in the infant mortality relative gap in both boys and girls was observed. In 2013, the U5MR evidenced that for boys from municipalities with the highest poverty had a 1.6-fold risk to die than those in municipalities with the lowest poverty (low tercile). In girls, the ARI-U5MR for 2005 and 2013 in the poorest tercile was 1.5 and 2 times greater than in the first tercile, respectively. Conclusion: Colombian inequalities in the ARI mortality rate among the poorest municipalities compared to the richest ones continue to be a major challenge in public health.},

Mortality due to hypertensive disease tended to concentrate in municipalities with a higher level of unsatisfied basic needs. The municipalities with a lower gross domestic product showed a higher rate of deaths due to hypertensive disease in years 2009 and 2010, and due to ischemic disease in years 2010 and 2011. Nevertheless, this indicator does not measure the gap existing among poor communities.Conclusions: Disaggregated inequality indicators at municipal level are lacking.

   abstract = {We aim to describe the role of educational inequalities, for sex and age groups, in adult tuberculosis (TB) mortality in Colombia, 1999-2017. We linked mortality data to data estimation of the national population based on censuses and surveys to obtain primary, secondary, and tertiary adult (25+ years of age) age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) by educational level. Thus, a population-based study was conducted using national secondary mortality data between 1999 and 2017. Tuberculosis age-standardized mortality rates were calculated separately by educational level, sex, and age groups, using Poisson regression models. Educational relative inequalities in adult mortality were evaluated by calculating the rate ratio, and the relative index of inequality (RII). Trends and joinpoints were evaluated by annual percentage change (APC). We found that, out of the 19,720 TB deaths reported, 69% occurred in men, and 45% in older adults (men and women, aged 65+). Men presented higher TB mortality rates than women (ASMR men = 7.1/100,000 inhabitants, ASMR women = 2.7/100,000 inhabitants). As mortality was consistently higher in the lowest educational level for both sexes and all age groups, inequalities in TB mortality were found to be high (RII = 9.7 and 13.4 among men and women, respectively) and growing at an annual rate of 8% and 1%. High and increasing inequalities, regarding educational level, in TB mortality in Colombia suggest the need to comprehensively address strategies for reducing TB by considering social determinants and including health education strategies throughout the country.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the magnitude of social determinants in areas of risk of mortality due to tuberculosis in a high incidence city. Method: Ecological study, which recruited the cases of tuberculosis deaths registered between 2006 and 2016 in the capital of Mato Grosso-Brazil. The social determinants were obtained from the Human Development Units. Sweep statistics were used to identify areas of risk of mortality due to tuberculosis. Principal component analysis was carried out to identify dimensions of social determinants. Multiple logistic regression was applied to verify associations between the dimensions of social determinants and the risk of mortality from tuberculosis. A 5% error was fixed. The standard error was established at 5% for all statistical tests. Results: A total of 225 deaths due to tuberculosis were registered in the period, distributed heterogeneously in the space. A cluster of risk for tuberculosis mortality was identified, with RR = 2.09 (95%CI: 1.48-2.94; p = 0.04). Social determinants, low educational level and poverty were associated with the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis (OR: 2.92; 95%CI: 1.17-7.28). Income had a negative association with the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis (OR: 0.05; 95%CI: 0.00-0.70). The value of the ROC curve of the model was 92.1%. Conclusions: The results confirmed that the risk of mortality due to tuberculosis is a problem associated with social determinants. Health policies and social protection programmes can collaborate to address this problem.},

   abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide; in 2016, over 95% of TB deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Although the incidence and deaths from TB have decreased in Brazil in recent years, the disease has increased in the vulnerable population, whose diagnosis is more delayed and the chances for abandonment and deaths are significantly higher. This study aimed to identify high-risk areas for TB mortality and evidence their social determinants through a sensitive tailored social index, in a context of high inequality in South Brazil. Methods: A multistep statistical methodology was developed, based on spatial clustering, categorical principal components analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). This study considered 138 spatial units in Curitiba, South Brazil. TB deaths (2008–2015) were obtained from the National Information Mortality System and social variables from the Brazilian Human Development Atlas (2013). Results: There were 128 TB deaths recorded in the study: the mortality rate was 0.9/100,000 inhabitants, minimum–maximum: 0–25.51/100,000, with a mean (standard deviation) of 1.07 (2.71), and 78 space units had no deaths. One risk cluster of TB mortality was found in the south region (RR = 2.64, p = 0.01). Considering the social variables, several clusters were identified in the social risk indicator (SRI): income (899.82/1752.94; 0.024), GINI Index (0.41/0.45; 0.010), and overcrowding (25.07/15.39; 0.032). The SRI showed a high capacity to discriminate the TB mortality areas (area under ROC curve 0.865, 95% CI: 0.796–0.934). Conclusions: A powerful risk map (SRI) was developed, allowing tailored and personalised interventions. The south of Curitiba was identified as a high-risk area for TB mortality and the majority of social variables. This methodological approach can be generalised to other areas and/or other public health problems.},

   abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><p>Rapid expansion of the standardised approach to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment that is recommended by WHO allowed more than 36 million people to be cured between 1995 and 2008, averting up to 6 million deaths. Yet tuberculosis remains a severe global public health threat. There are more than 9 million new cases every year worldwide, and the incidence rate is falling at less than 1% per year. Although the overall target related to the Millennium Development Goals of halting and beginning to reverse the epidemic might have already been reached in 2004, the more important long-term elimination target set for 2050 will not be met with present strategies and instruments. Several key challenges persist. Many vulnerable people do not have access to affordable services of sufficient quality. Technologies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are old and inadequate. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious threat in many settings. HIV/AIDS continues to fuel the tuberculosis epidemic, especially in Africa. Furthermore, other risk factors and underlying social determinants help to maintain tuberculosis in the community. Acceleration of the decline towards elimination of this disease will need invigorated actions in four broad areas: continued scale-up of early diagnosis and proper treatment for all forms of tuberculosis in line with the Stop TB Strategy; development and enforcement of bold health-system policies; establishment of links with the broader development agenda; and promotion and intensification of research towards innovations.</p>},

   abstract = {Objectives: The objectives of our study were (1) to determine risk factors associated with tuberculosis (TB)–specific and non–TB-specific mortality among patients with TB and (2) to examine whether risk factors for TB-specific mortality differed from those for non–TB-specific mortality. Methods: We obtained data from the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System and included all patients who had TB between 2009 and 2013 in the United States and its territories. We used multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of each risk factor for TB-specific and non–TB-specific mortality. Results: Of 52 175 eligible patients with TB, 1404 died from TB, and 2413 died from other causes. Some of the risk factors associated with the highest odds of TB-specific mortality were multidrug-resistant TB diagnosis (aOR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.95- 5.99), end-stage renal disease (aOR = 3.02; 95% CI, 2.23-4.08), human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR = 2.63; 95% CI, 2.02-3.42), age 45-64 years (aOR = 2.57; 95% CI, 2.01-3.30) or age ≥65 years (aOR = 5.76; 95% CI, 4.37-7.61), and immunosuppression (aOR = 2.20; 95% CI, 1.71-2.83). All of these risk factors except multidrug-resistant TB were also associated with increased odds of non–TB-specific mortality. Conclusion: TB patients with certain risk factors have an elevated risk of TB-specific mortality and should be monitored before, during, and after treatment. Identifying the predictors of TB-specific mortality may help public health authorities determine which subpopulations to target and where to allocate resources.},

   abstract = {Background: The tuberculosis targets for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for a 90% reduction in tuberculosis deaths by 2030, compared with 2015, but meeting this target now seems highly improbable. To assess the economic impact of not meeting the target until 2045, we estimated full-income losses in 120 countries, including those due to excess deaths resulting from COVID-19-related disruptions to tuberculosis services, for the period 2020–50. Methods: Annual mortality risk changes at each age in each year from 2020 to 2050 were estimated for 120 countries. This risk change was then converted to full-income risk by calculating a population-level mortality risk change and multiplying it by the value of a statistical life-year in each country and year. As a comparator, we assumed that current rates of tuberculosis continue to decline through the period of analysis. We calculated the full-income losses, and mean life expectancy losses per person, at birth and at age 35 years, under scenarios in which the SDG targets are met in 2030 and in 2045. We defined the cost of inaction as the difference in full-income losses and tuberculosis mortality between these two scenarios. Findings: From 2020 to 2050, based on the current annual decrease in tuberculosis deaths of 2%, 31·8 million tuberculosis deaths (95% uncertainty interval 25·2 million–39·5 million) are estimated to occur, corresponding to an economic loss of US$17·5 trillion (14·9 trillion–20·4 trillion). If the SDG tuberculosis mortality target is met in 2030, 23·8 million tuberculosis deaths (18·9 million–29·5 million) and $13·1 trillion (11·2 trillion–15·3 trillion) in economic losses can be avoided. If the target is met in 2045, 18·1 million tuberculosis deaths (14·3 million–22·4 million) and $10·2 trillion (8·7 trillion–11·8 trillion) can be avoided. The cost of inaction of not meeting the SDG tuberculosis mortality target until 2045 (vs 2030) is, therefore, 5·7 million tuberculosis deaths (5·1 million–8·1 million) and $3·0 trillion (2·5 trillion–3·5 trillion) in economic losses. COVID-19-related disruptions add $290·3 billion (260·2 billion–570·1 billion) to this cost. Interpretation: Failure to achieve the SDG tuberculosis mortality target by 2030 will lead to profound economic and health losses. The effects of delay will be greatest in sub-Saharan Africa. Affected countries, donor nations, and the private sector should redouble efforts to finance tuberculosis programmes and research because the economic dividend of such strategies is likely to be substantial. Funding: None.},

An ecological study was developed in Curitiba, Brazil based on data from Mortality Information System (2008-2014). Spatial scan statistics were used to compute RR and identify high-risk clusters. Bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Associations was used to assess associations. MR ranged between 0 and 25.24/100.000 with a mean (standard deviation) of 1.07 (2.66). Corresponding values for spatial RR were 0-27.46, 1.2 (2.99) and for Bayesian rates (Global and Local) were 0.49-1.66, 0.90 (0.19) and 0-6.59, 0.98 (0.80). High-risk clusters were identified for all variables, except for HDI-income and Global Bayesian rate. Significant negative spatial relations were found between MR and income; between RR and HDI global, longevity and income; and Bayesian rates with all variables. Some areas presented different patterns: low social development/low risk and high risk/high development. These results demonstrate that social development variables should be considered, in mortality due TB.},

El estudio fue aplicado a 2.988 empresas que reportaron información financiera a la Superintendencia de Sociedades (Colombia) durante el año 2017, de las cuales 127 entraron en proceso de insolvencia en 2018. El pronóstico considera indicadores financieros de liquidez, rentabilidad y endeudamiento, y contrasta los resultados de la regresión logística con el algoritmo boosting. Se concluye que los indicadores financieros permiten pronosticar la insolvencia empresarial, sin embargo se debe recurrir a metodologías no tradicionales como el algoritmo boosting que consideren la asimetría de la información.},

It has been suggested that traditional ratio analysis is no longer an important analytical technique in the academic environment due to the relatively unsophisticated manner in which it has been presented. In order to assess its potential rigorously, a set of financial ratios was combined in a discriminant analysis approach to the problem of corporate bankruptcy prediction. The theory is that ratios, if analyzed within a multivariate framework, will take on greater statistical significance than the common technique of sequential ratio comparisons.

Single-period models are inconsistent, while hazard models produce consistent estimates. I describe a simple technique for estimating a discrete-time hazard model. I find that about half of the accounting ratios that have been used in previous models are not statistically significant. Moreover, market size, past stock returns, and idiosyncratic returns variability are all strongly related to bankruptcy. I propose a model that uses both accounting ratios and market-driven variables to produce out-of-sample forecasts that are more accurate than those of alternative models.

From traditional statistical models to state of the art machine learning models, various predictive models are developed and applied to various datasets. However, models that use machine learning are not used in the field of business, for two main reasons. First, the prediction accuracy does not far exceed the statistical models and second, the results are not interpretable. In this study, we focused on solving the skewness which is a characteristic of financial data. By solving this problem, we obtained 17% average improvement in AUC over existing models. To address the second shortcoming, we analyze the importance of features identified by the XGBoost model. The interpretation of the model differs among categories of data. Our bankruptcy prediction model has high predictive accuracy with clear explanations and is therefore directly applicable to the industry.},

   abstract = {The bankruptcy prediction research domain continues to evolve with many new different predictive models developed using various tools. Yet many of the tools are used with the wrong data conditions or for the wrong situation. Using the Web of Science, Business Source Complete and Engineering Village databases, a systematic review of 49 journal articles published between 2010 and 2015 was carried out. This review shows how eight popular and promising tools perform based on 13 key criteria within the bankruptcy prediction models research area. These tools include two statistical tools: multiple discriminant analysis and Logistic regression; and six artificial intelligence tools: artificial neural network, support vector machines, rough sets, case based reasoning, decision tree and genetic algorithm. The 13 criteria identified include accuracy, result transparency, fully deterministic output, data size capability, data dispersion, variable selection method required, variable types applicable, and more. Overall, it was found that no single tool is predominantly better than other tools in relation to the 13 identified criteria. A tabular and a diagrammatic framework are provided as guidelines for the selection of tools that best fit different situations. It is concluded that an overall better performance model can only be found by informed integration of tools to form a hybrid model. This paper contributes towards a thorough understanding of the features of the tools used to develop bankruptcy prediction models and their related shortcomings.},

Optimization goals and design variables (process parameters during PIM) are specified by the requirement of manufacture. A BP artificial neural network model is developed to obtain the mathematical relationship between the optimization goals and process parameters. Genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the process parameters that would result in optimal solution of the optimization goals. A case study of a plastic article is presented. Warpage as well as clamp force during PIM are investigated as the optimization objectives.

   abstract = {The learning process and hyper-parameter optimization of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning (DL) architectures is considered one of the most challenging machine learning problems. Several past studies have used gradient-based back propagation methods to train DL architectures. However, gradient-based methods have major drawbacks such as stucking at local minimums in multi-objective cost functions, expensive execution time due to calculating gradient information with thousands of iterations and needing the cost functions to be continuous. Since training the ANNs and DLs is an NP-hard optimization problem, their structure and parameters optimization using the meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms has been considerably raised. MH algorithms can accurately formulate the optimal estimation of DL components (such as hyper-parameter, weights, number of layers, number of neurons, learning rate, etc.). This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of ANNs and DLs using MH algorithms. In this paper, we have reviewed the latest developments in the use of MH algorithms in the DL and ANN methods, presented their disadvantages and advantages, and pointed out some research directions to fill the gaps between MHs and DL methods. Moreover, it has been explained that the evolutionary hybrid architecture still has limited applicability in the literature. Also, this paper classifies the latest MH algorithms in the literature to demonstrate their effectiveness in DL and ANN training for various applications. Most researchers tend to extend novel hybrid algorithms by combining MHs to optimize the hyper-parameters of DLs and ANNs. The development of hybrid MHs helps improving algorithms performance and capable of solving complex optimization problems. In general, the optimal performance of the MHs should be able to achieve a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation features. Hence, this paper tries to summarize various MH algorithms in terms of the convergence trend, exploration, exploitation, and the ability to avoid local minima. The integration of MH with DLs is expected to accelerate the training process in the coming few years. However, relevant publications in this way are still rare.},

Despite the fact that BP is still used today when FNNs are trained, it has some disadvantages, including the following: (i) it fails when non-differentiable functions are addressed, (ii) it can become trapped in local minima, and (iii) it has slow convergence. In order to solve some of these problems, metaheuristic algorithms have been used to train FNN. Although they have good exploration skills, they are not as good as gradient-based algorithms at exploitation tasks. The main contribution of this article lies in its application of novel memetic approaches based on the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (CGSA) algorithms, called respectively Memetic Gravitational Search Algorithm (MGSA) and Memetic Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (MCGSA), to train FNNs in three classical benchmark problems: the XOR problem, the approximation of a continuous function, and classification tasks. The results show that both approaches constitute suitable alternatives for training FNNs, even improving on the performance of other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as ParticleSwarm Optimization (PSO), the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm with Repaired crossover rate (Rcr-JADE), and the Covariance matrix learning and Bimodal distribution parameter setting Differential Evolution (COBIDE) algorithm. Swarm optimization, the genetic algorithm, the adaptive differential evolution algorithm with repaired crossover rate, and the covariance matrix learning and bimodal distribution parameter setting differential evolution algorithm.},
